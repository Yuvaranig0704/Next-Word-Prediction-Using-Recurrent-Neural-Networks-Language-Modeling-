       "' = valkyria chronicles iii = \\n  senjō no valkyria 3 : unrecorded chronicles ( japanese : 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 ) , commonly referred to as valkyria chronicles iii outside japan , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by sega and media.vision for the playstation portable . released in january 2011 in japan , it is the third game in the valkyria series . employing the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors , the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the \" nameless \" , a penal military unit serving the nation of gallia during the second europan war who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the imperial unit \" calamaty raven \" . \\n  the game began development in 2010 , carrying over a large portion of the work done on valkyria chronicles ii . while it retained the standard features of the series , it also underwent multiple adjustments , such as making the game more forgiving for series newcomers . character designer raita honjou and composer hitoshi sakimoto both returned from previous entries , along with valkyria chronicles ii director takeshi ozawa . a large team of writers handled the script . the game \\'s opening theme was sung by may \\'n . \\n  it met with positive sales in japan , and was praised by both japanese and western critics . after release , it received downloadable content , along with an expanded edition in november of that year . it was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series . due to low sales of valkyria chronicles ii , valkyria chronicles iii was not localized , but a fan translation compatible with the game \\'s expanded edition was released in 2014 . media.vision would return to the franchise with the development of valkyria : azure revolution for the playstation 4 . \\n  = = gameplay = = \\n  as with previous valkyira chronicles games , valkyria chronicles iii is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . the player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . the route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player \\'s approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . after the game \\'s completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . there are also love simulation elements related to the game \\'s two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \\n  the game \\'s battle system , the blitz system , is carried over directly from valkyira chronicles . during missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . a character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters \\' turns . each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their action gauge . up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . during gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( hp ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . each character has specific \" potentials \" , skills unique to each character . they are divided into \" personal potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" battle potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . to learn battle potentials , each character has a unique \" masters table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . characters also have special abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : kurt can activate \" direct command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his action point gauge , the character reila can shift into her \" valkyria form \" and become invincible , while imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \\n  troops are divided into five classes : scouts , shocktroopers , engineers , lancers and armored soldier . troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . with victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games \\' method of distributing to different unit types . \\n  = = plot = = \\n  the game takes place during the second europan war . gallian army squad 422 , also known as \" the nameless \" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . ordered by the gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the regular army and militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , altaha abilia , meaning \" always ready . \" the three main characters are no.7 kurt irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; ace no.1 imca , a female darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the valkyria who destroyed her home ; and no.13 riela marcellis , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the valkyria . together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious imperial unit known as calamity raven , consisting of mostly darcsen soldiers . \\n  as the nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the gallian army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make gallia lose face in the war . while at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . one such member , gusurg , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of calamity raven , attached to the ideal of darcsen independence proposed by their leader , dahau . at the same time , elements within gallian army command move to erase the nameless in order to protect their own interests . hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the gallian war effort . this continues until the nameless \\'s commanding officer , ramsey crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the gallian general that had accused kurt of treason . \\n  partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the empire , the nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the gallian army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force . this is short @-@ lived , however , as following maximilian \\'s defeat , dahau and calamity raven move to activate an ancient valkyrian super weapon within the empire , kept secret by their benefactor . without the support of maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with gallia , it is dahau \\'s last trump card in creating a new darcsen nation . as an armed gallian force invading the empire just following the two nations \\' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , kurt decides to once again make his squad the nameless , asking crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action . now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts dahau and destroys the valkyrian weapon . each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew . \\n  = = development = = \\n  concept work for valkyria chronicles iii began after development finished on valkyria chronicles ii in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . the director of valkyria chronicles ii , takeshi ozawa , returned to that role for valkyria chronicles iii . development work took approximately one year . after the release of valkyria chronicles ii , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . like its predecessor , valkyria chronicles iii was developed for playstation portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for valkyria chronicles ii , and they had not come up with the \" revolutionary \" idea that would warrant a new entry for the playstation 3 . speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered valkyria chronicles iii to be the series \\' first true sequel : while valkyria chronicles ii had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of valkyria chronicles ii due to being on the same platform . in addition to sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by media.vision. the original scenario was written kazuki yamanobe , while the script was written by hiroyuki fujii , koichi majima , kishiko miyagi , seiki nagakawa and takayuki shouji . its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor . \\n  the majority of material created for previous games , such as the blitz system and the design of maps , was carried over . alongside this , improvements were made to the game \\'s graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . a part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character \\'s body . in order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . they also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series \\' gameplay . the newer systems were decided upon early in development . the character designs were done by raita honjou , who had worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games . when creating the nameless squad , honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the valkyria chronicles world . the main color of the nameless was black . as with the previous valkyria games , valkyria chronicles iii used the canvas graphics engine . the anime opening was produced by production i.g. \\n  = = = music = = = \\n  the music was composed by hitoshi sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games . when he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other valkyria chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . an early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . he redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . the main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . the rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game \\'s ending . the battle themes were designed around the concept of a \" modern battle \" divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . while sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . the guitar was played by mitsuhiro ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . the game \\'s opening theme song , \" if you wish for ... \" ( もしも君が願うのなら , moshimo kimi ga negauno nara ) , was sung by japanese singer may \\'n . its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . its lyrics were written by seiko fujibayashi , who had worked on may \\'n on previous singles . \\n  = = = release = = = \\n  in september 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by sega , hinting at a new valkyria chronicles game . in its september issue , famitsu listed that senjō no valkyria 3 would be arriving on the playstation portable . its first public appearance was at the 2010 tokyo game show ( tgs ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . during the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . to promote the game and detail the story leading into the game \\'s events , an episodic flash visual novel written by fujii began release in january 2011 . the game was released january 27 , 2011 . during an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( dlc ) , but that no plans were finalized . multiple dlc maps , featuring additional missions and recruitable characters , were released between february and april 2011 . an expanded edition of the game , valkyria chronicles iii extra edition , released on november 23 , 2011 . packaged and sold at a lower price than the original , extra edition game with seven additional episodes : three new , three chosen by staff from the game \\'s dlc , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . people who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions . \\n  unlike its two predecessors , valkyria chronicles iii was not released in the west . according to sega , this was due to poor sales of valkyria chronicles ii and the general unpopularity of the psp in the west . an unofficial fan translation patch began development in february 2012 : players with a copy of valkyria chronicles iii could download and apply the patch , which translated the game \\'s text into english . compatible with the extra edition , the patch was released in january 2014 . \\n  = = reception = = \\n  on its day of release in japan , valkyria chronicles iii topped both platform @-@ exclusive and multi @-@ platform sales charts . by early february , the game sold 102 @,@ 779 units , coming in second overall to the last story for the wii . by the end of the year , the game had sold just over 152 @,@ 500 units . \\n  famitsu enjoyed the story , and were particularly pleased with the improvements to gameplay . japanese gaming site game watch impress , despite negatively noting its pacing and elements recycled from previous games , was generally positive about its story and characters , and found its gameplay entertaining despite off @-@ putting difficulty spikes . 4gamer.net writer naohiko misuosame , in a \" play test \" article based on the game \\'s psn demo , felt that valkyria chronicles iii provided a \" profound feeling of closure \" for the valkyria chronicles series . he praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities , and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game . \\n  playstation official magazine - uk praised the story \\'s blurring of gallia \\'s moral standing , art style , and most points about its gameplay , positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content . its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes , something that had affected the previous games . heath hindman of gaming website playstation lifestyle praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from valkyria chronicles ii in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games . he also positively noted the story \\'s serious tone . points criticized in the review were recycled elements , awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason , pacing issues , and occasional problems with the game \\'s ai . \\n  in a preview of the tgs demo , ryan geddes of ign was left excited as to where the game would go after completing the demo , along with enjoying the improved visuals over valkyria chronicles ii . kotaku \\'s richard eisenbeis was highly positive about the game , citing is story as a return to form after valkyria chronicles ii and its gameplay being the best in the series . his main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition , along with expressing regret that it would not be localized . \\n  = = legacy = = \\n  kurt and riela were featured in the nintendo 3ds crossover project x zone , representing the valkyria series . media.vision would return to the series to develop valkyria : azure revolution , with ozawa returning as director . azure revolution is a role @-@ playing video game for the playstation 4 that forms the beginning of a new series within the valkyria franchise . \\n  = = = adaptations = = = \\n  valkyria chronicles 3 was adapted into a two @-@ episode original video animation series in the same year of its release . titled senjō no valkyria 3 : taga tame no jūsō ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア３ 誰がための銃瘡 , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 : the wound taken for someone \\'s sake ) , it was originally released through playstation network and qriocity between april and may 2011 . the initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to psn during the early summer of that year . it later released for dvd on june 29 and august 31 , 2011 , with separate \" black \" and \" blue \" editions being available for purchase . the anime is set during the latter half of valkyria chronicles iii , detailing a mission by the nameless against their imperial rivals calamity raven . the anime was first announced in november 2010 . it was developed by a @-@ 1 pictures , produced by shinji motoyama , directed by nobuhiro kondō , and written by hiroshi ōnogi . sakimoto \\'s music for the game was used in the anime . \\n  the anime \\'s title was inspired by the principle purpose of the nameless : to suffer in battle for the goals of others . a subtitle attached to the project during development was \" the road to kubinka \" , which referenced the kubinka tank museum in moscow . the game \\'s main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities , along with general themes focused on war and its consequences . while making the anime , the production team were told by sega to make it as realistic as possible , with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged . due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation , the cast of valkyria chronicles could make appearances , which pleased the team . the opening theme , \" akari ( light ) -tomoshibi- \" ( 灯 @-@ tomoshibi- ) , was sung by japanese singer faylan . the ending theme , \" someday the flowers of light will bloom \" ( いつか咲く光の花 , itsuka saku hikari no hana ) , was sung by minami kuribayashi . both songs \\' lyrics were written by their respective artists . \\n  two manga adaptations were produced , following each of the game \\'s main female protagonists imca and riela . they were senjō no valkyria 3 : namo naki chikai no hana ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 名もなき誓いの花 , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 : the flower of the nameless oath ) , illustrated by naoyuki fujisawa and eventually released in two volumes after being serialized in dengeki maoh between 2011 and 2012 ; and senjō no valkyria 3 : -akaki unmei no ikusa otome- ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 -赤き運命の戦乙女- , lit . valkyria of the battlefield 3 -the valkyrie of the crimson fate ) , illustrated by mizuki tsuge and eventually released in a single volume by kadokawa shoten in 2012 . \\n  = tower building of the little rock arsenal = \\n  the tower building of the little rock arsenal , also known as u.s. arsenal building , is a building located in macarthur park in downtown little rock , arkansas . built in 1840 , it was part of little rock \\'s first military installation . since its decommissioning , the tower building has housed two museums . it was home to the arkansas museum of natural history and antiquities from 1942 to 1997 and the macarthur museum of arkansas military history since 2001 . it has also been the headquarters of the little rock æsthetic club since 1894 . \\n  the building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower . besides being the last remaining structure of the original little rock arsenal and one of the oldest buildings in central arkansas , it was also the birthplace of general douglas macarthur , who became the supreme commander of us forces in the south pacific during world war ii . it was also the starting place of the camden expedition . in 2011 it was named as one of the top 10 attractions in the state of arkansas by arkansas.com. \\n  = = construction = = \\n  the arsenal was constructed at the request of governor james sevier conway in response to the perceived dangers of frontier life and fears of the many native americans who were passing through the state on their way to the newly established oklahoma territory . thirty @-@ six acres were appropriated on the outskirts of little rock by major robert b. lee of the u.s. army . the land had been previously used as a racetrack by the local jockey club . john wormley walker , a builder for the federal government , supervised the construction . originally $ 14 @,@ 000 was allocated for the construction of the arsenal , but proved inadequate . the budget was later increased to $ 30 @,@ 000 . work began on the tower building in 1840 , and it was the first permanent structure of the arsenal to be built . being originally constructed to store ammunition , the building was designed with 3 @-@ foot @-@ thick ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) exterior walls . the original plans called for it to be built of stone , however , masonry was used instead . the arkansas gazette referred to the structure as \" a splendid specimen of masonry \" . \\n  = = civil war = = \\n  for several years the arsenal , which was owned by the federal government , served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers . but in november 1860 , with the american civil war on the horizon , a company of the second united states artillery , consisting of sixty @-@ five men , was transferred to little rock under the command of captain james totten . on january 15 , 1861 , the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention . it was planned for february 18 ; however , events at the arsenal , would not wait . on january 28 , then governor henry massey rector informed captain totten that he and his soldiers would be \" permitted to remain in the possession of the federal officers until the state , by authority of the people , shall have determined to sever their connection with the general government , \" totten responded to this by telling the governor that his orders came from the united states government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements , although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming . the first telegraph wire to span between little rock and memphis had recently been completed . local attorney john m harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from arkansas \\'s capital . in his message , harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the little rock arsenal . \\n  the united states troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at fort smith . the garrison at fort smith had been previously transferred to the united states arsenal in this city ( little rock ) . the arsenal is one of the richest depositories of military stores in the united states and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the tropps [ sic ] ordered from the frontier . \\n  -john m harrel telegram , january 31 , 1861 \\n  the item was intended simply as a piece of news , but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state , fueling procession sentiment . the rumor was interpreted by some arkansans as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal . by february 5 , six militia units , consisting of 1 @,@ 000 men , with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5 @,@ 000 if the situations deemed it necessary , had assembled in little rock . governor rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops . faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of little rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops , governor rector was forced to take control of the situation . on february 6 , he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to captain totten , \\n  this movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this state that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the arsenal should be under the control of the state authorities , in order to their security . this movement , although not authorized by me , has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty , as the executive of this sate , to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the state and the federal troops under your command . i therefore demand in the name of the state the delivery of the possession of the arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the state authorities , to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of march next . \\n  perhaps because abraham lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as president , captain totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops . he agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions : \\n  the governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the united states . \\n  the soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war . \\n  the soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders , not as conquered and surrendering soldiers . \\n  on the morning of february 8 , 1861 , rector and totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials . that afternoon , the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with governor rector at its head . all of the federal troops had left at this point , except totten who had stayed behind to listen to the governor \\'s speech and to hand the arsenal over in person . \\n  the little rock arsenal was classified in 1860 as an \" arsenal of deposit , \" meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis . thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs , nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the arsenal fell into state hands . most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the arkansas military board . \\n  inside the little rock arsenal after its seizure in february , 1861 , the confederates inventoried some 10 @,@ 247 weapons , 250 @,@ 000 musket cartridges , and 520 @,@ 000 percussion caps , as well as the four bronze cannon of totten \\'s battery . long arms in the arsenal \\'s inventory consisted of : \\n  m1822 .69 cal ( flintlock ) 5 @,@ 625 \\n  m1822 .69 cal ( percussion @-@ converted ) 53 \\n  m1842 .69 cal smoothbore ( percussion ) 357 \\n  m1855 .58 cal rifle @-@ muskets 900 \\n  m1817 common rifles 125 \\n  m1841 rifle ( \" mississippi rifle \" ) 54 \\n  m1847 musketoon 2 \\n  hall \\'s carbines 267 \\n  hall \\'s rifles ( flintlock ) 2 @,@ 864 \\n  total 10 @,@ 247 \\n  of this number , approximately 9600 weapons were serviceable , or ready @-@ for @-@ issue . note there were only 1 @,@ 364 percussion weapons available . disposition of the weapons found in the arsenal is somewhat sketchy , but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th , 6th , 7th , and 8th arkansas infantry regiments , mustered in june , 1861 , were issued m1816 / m1822 .69 caliber flintlocks . the 9th and 10th arkansas , four companies of kelly \\'s 9th arkansas battalion , and the 3rd arkansas cavalry regiment were issued flintlock hall \\'s rifles . the units comprising the infantry force of van dorn \\'s army of the west were the 1st and 2nd arkansas mounted rifles were also armed with m1822 flintlocks from the little rock arsenal . by the time the 11th and 12th arkansas infantry regiments mustered in at little rock , the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted , and only old \" junker \" weapons were left . \\n  most of the equipment , arms , and machinery at the little rock arsenal was removed to east of the mississippi river by order of maj. gen. earl van dorn in april and may 1862 , and accountability for it is lost at that point . by all appearances , the equipment was sent down the river to napoleon , arkansas , and from there to jackson mississippi , where it was probably destroyed during the vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863 . \\n  major general thomas c. hindman , sent to command the district of arkansas in may , 1862 , found the state nearly destitute of military material . hindman established another armory at arkadelphia , and revived the little rock arsenal as a collection point and depot for armaments and ammunition manufacture for small arms . hindman recorded : \\n  \" machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms , and both were turned out in small quantity , but of excellent quality . lead mines were opened and worked , and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the ordnance department and in the manufacture of calomel , castor oil , spirits of nitre , the various tinctures of iron , and other valuable medicines . most of these works were located at or near arkadelphia on the ouachita river , 75 miles south from little rock . the tools , machinery , and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor . nothing of this sort had been before attempted on government account in arkansas to my knowledge , except for the manufacture of small arms , the machinery for which was taken away by general van dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings � a further supply , along with lead and caps , was procured from the citizens of little rock and vicinity by donation , purchases , and impressments . \\n  this ammunition , and that which i brought with me , was rapidly prepared for use at the laboratory established at the little rock arsenal for that purpose . as illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country , the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the state library for cartridge paper . gunsmiths were employed or conscripted , tools purchased or impressed , and the repair of the damaged guns i brought with me and about an equal number found at little rock commenced at once . but , after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men i decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against fitch and that i would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to gen \\'l rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from little rock instead of pikes and lances , with which most of them were armed . two days elapsed before the change could be effected . \" \\n  the confederate ordnance establishment at little rock was reactivated in august , 1862 . looking around for a suitable person to head this activity , general hindman turned to the confederate navy and borrowed lieutenant john w. dunnington . lt. dunnington was the commander of the gunboat c.s.s. ponchartrain , which had been brought to little rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad . dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at little rock , and although he continued to draw his pay from the confederate navy department , he was placed in charge of all confederate ordnance activities ( which included artillery functions ) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel . \\n  lt. col. dunnington \\'s \" returns for the month of august , 1862 , at little rock arsenal , c.s.a. , \" are found in vol . 149 , chapter iv of the \" captured rebel ordnance records , \" and are most enlightening as to the scope of confederate ordnance activities at little rock during this crucial time . according to dunnington , \" when i assumed command at this post , all material had been removed to arkadelphia . there were no persons employed . no shops were open for repair of arms or for fabricating ammunition . material , tools , etc . , had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers . work commenced the last part of the month . \" \\n  the military force at little rock under dunnington \\'s command consisted of four officers : himself , major john b. lockman , captain c.c. green , and 2nd lt. w.w. murphy . in addition to these , he had 20 enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a foreman , 2 clerks , 3 gunsmiths for repairing small arms , a laboratorian , 26 laborers in the ammunition laboratory , and a carpenter for making packing boxes . \\n  during the month of august , 1862 , the following work was performed : \" fabricated : one pair of musket bullet moulds ; 10 @,@ 000 buck & ball shot cartridges ; repaired : 750 muskets , shotguns , and rifles ; received and repaired : ordnance stores and ordnances ; performed : guard , office , and police duties ; inspected : posts at camden and arkadelphia . \" \\n  lt. col. dunnington continued to build up his works at little rock until november 1862 , when captain sanford c. faulkner ( composer of the arkansas traveler ) was placed in charge of the arsenal . dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the ponchartrain . \\n  a \" summary of the work done for november , 1862 , little rock arsenal \" shows : fabrication : \\n  75 @,@ 000 buck & ball cartridges - percussion \\n  14 @,@ 000 buck & ball cartridges - flint \\n  275 paper fuzes \\n  117 rounds , 6 @-@ pounder canister shot \\n  130 rounds , 6 @-@ pounder ball shot \\n  96 ammunition packing boxes \\n  repaired : \\n  2 @,@ 236 shotguns and rifles ( repaired mostly for troops in service ) \\n  23 pistols ( repaired mostly for troops in service ) \\n  received & issued : \\n  752 packages of ordnance and ordnance stores received and mostly issued to troops in service . \\n  repaired and painted : \\n  4 gun carriages \\n  performed : \\n  guard , office , and police duties . \\n  perhaps the most illuminating points of the above \" summary of work \" and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was . \" buck & ball \" , indicating that the .69 caliber smoothbores and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use , and of this , nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons , indicating that no less than a sixth of the confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons . \\n  the \" summaries of work done at little rock arsenal , c.s.a. \" continue at about the same pace and scale from august 1862 until august 1863 . appended to the \" summary \" for august , 1863 is the ominous notation , \" during the last week in the month , nearly all stores at the arsenal have been packed and sent to arkadelphia , in obedience to orders from chief of ordnance , district of arkansas . \" this then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from little rock , with the city being surrendered to the advancing federal troops of frederick steele \\'s arkansas expedition on september 11 , 1863 . \\n  in 1864 , after little rock fell to the union army and the arsenal had been recaptured , general fredrick steele marched 8 @,@ 500 troops from the arsenal beginning the camden expedition . \\n  the arsenal was briefly seized once more by joseph brooks loyalists during the brooks @-@ baxter war of 1874 . \\n  = = decommissioning = = \\n  in 1873 , the building was renamed little rock barracks and used as a barracks for married officers and their families . the building was drastically altered the inside and outside . prior to renovation , a rear basement door provided the only entrance to the building , while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors . by 1868 , front and rear porches had been added to the building , as well as interior walls and stairs , some of which remain today , including the central staircase . in 1880 , douglas macarthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father , captain arthur macarthur , was stationed there . \\n  in the 1880s , the federal government began closing many small arsenals around the country in favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment . the arsenal commander received word from washington that the little rock site must be abandoned \" not later than october 1 , 1890 . \" on april 12 , 1893 the tower building and the surrounding buildings were traded to the city of little

acres ( 4 km ² ) in big rock mountain on the north side of the arkansas river , present day north little rock . that site later became fort logan h. roots . all of the original buildings surrounding the tower building were demolished . \\n  = = æsthetic club = = \\n  in 1894 the little rock æsthetic club , one of the oldest women \\'s societies west of the mississippi river , moved into the tower building . this was prompted due to increased membership and a need for larger , more permanent quarters . the previous year , club members working with women \\'s organizations throughout the state , raised money to furnish the arkansas building of the columbian exposition at the chicago world \\'s fair . at the fair \\'s conclusion , artifacts from the exhibit were displayed in the tower building , with the æsthetic club invited to meet in the \" columbian room . \" \\n  except for æsthetic club meetings , the tower building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration . the æsthetic club provided much @-@ needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the great depression . the æsthetic club is still headquartered in the tower building . \\n  = = public use = = \\n  the building and the surrounding park were used for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century . the tower building served as headquarters for the united confederate veterans reunion , may 15 – 18 , 1911 . over 106 @,@ 000 civil war veterans , the largest popular gathering in the history of the city up to that time , attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park , which had also become a popular camping area . later the building served as an armory for the arkansas national guard . in 1912 , the second floor of the tower building became little rock \\'s first public library . in 1917 , little rock built a fire station in the park , that building is now gone . a band shell named for h. h. foster also was built in the park during this time , but also no longer exists . in 1936 , works progress administration built the museum of fine arts , now called the arkansas arts center , just south of the tower building . \\n  the arsenal was listed in the national register of historic places in 1970 . due to its association with the camden expedition of 1864 , the arsenal may be included in the camden expedition sites national historic landmark designated in 1994 . \\n  in 1942 , the tower building was renovated due to the efforts of the æsthetic club , little rock philanthropist frederick w. allsop , and the works progress administration . it became the new home of the arkansas museum of natural history and antiquities , which had been located in little rock city hall . the museum remained in the tower building for approximately fifty @-@ five years . the area surrounding the tower building had been known as arsenal park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed city park . due to the efforts of bernie babcock , however , the city finally named it macarthur park in 1942 in honor of douglas macarthur . \\n  in 1997 , the museum of science and natural history merged with the little rock children \\'s museum , which had been located in union station , to form the arkansas museum of discovery . the new museum was relocated to a historic building in the little rock river market district . the macarthur museum of arkansas military history opened on may 19 , 2001 in the tower building . the new museum \\'s goal is to educate and inform visitors about the military history of arkansas , preserve the tower building , honor servicemen and servicewomen of the united states and commemorate the birthplace of douglas macarthur . \\n  = cicely mary

her first book , flower fairies of the spring , was published in 1923 . similar books were published in the following decades . \\n  barker was a devout anglican , and donated her artworks to christian fundraisers and missionary organizations . she produced a few christian @-@ themed books such as the children ’ s book of hymns and , in collaboration with her sister dorothy , he leadeth me . she designed a stained glass window for st. edmund \\'s church , pitlake , and her painting of the christ child , the darling of the world has come , was purchased by queen mary . \\n  barker was equally proficient in watercolour , pen and ink , oils , and pastels . kate greenaway and the pre @-@ raphaelites were the principal influences on her work . she claimed to paint instinctively and rejected artistic theories . barker died in 1973 . though she published flower fairy books with spring , summer , and autumn themes , it wasn \\'t until 1985 that a winter collection was assembled from her remaining work and published posthumously . \\n  = = biography = = \\n  = = = early life = = = \\n  barker was born the second daughter and youngest child of walter barker , a partner in a

and cared for at home by her parents . later , her sister and elder by two years , dorothy oswald barker , continued the care . \\n  the family of four was moderately well off , and belonged to the lower end of the upper middle class . a nanny , a governess , and a cook to prepare special meals for barker were hired . she spent much time in bed at home amusing herself with painting books and a

1911 , she won second prize in the croydon art society \\'s poster competition , and shortly afterward was elected the youngest member of the society . the art critic for the croydon advertiser remarked , \" her drawings show a remarkable freedom of spirit . she has distinct promise . \" \\n  following her father ’ s death in june 1912 , the seventeen @-@ year @-@ old barker submitted art and poetry to my magazine , child ’ s own , leading strings , and raphael tuck annuals in an effort to support both her mother and sister . her sister dorothy taught kindergarten in two private

series depicting elves and fairies . \\n  in 1923 , barker sent her flower fairy paintings to various publishers . blackie paid £ 25 for 24 paintings with accompanying verses , but it wasn \\'t until publication of flower fairies of the summer in 1925 that barker received royalties for her work . mary violet clayton calthrop , wife of author dion clayton calthrop , wrote in april 1925 about barker and flower fairies of the spring : \" she has such exquisite taste , besides draughtsmanship . \" \\n  = = = the waldrons = = = \\n  in 1924 , the family moved into a four @-@ level , semi @-@

attended both st. edmund \\'s and st. andrew \\'s in croydon – \" low \" churches for the less privileged . barker sometimes incorporated portraits of her fellow parishioners in her religious works . she was described by canon ingram hill as \" one of the pillars \" of st. andrew \\'s . \\n  the children in the kindergarten modelled for the flower fairies until the kindergarten closed in 1940 . in an interview in 1958 , barker said , \" my sister ran a kindergarten and i used to borrow her students for models . for many years i had an atmosphere of children about me – i never forgot it . \" she also painted the children of relatives as well as gladys tidy , the barkers \\' young housekeeper , who posed for the primrose fairy in 1923 . the plants were painted from life , and if a specimen was not readily at hand , kew gardens staff would provide her the specimens needed . barker designed and built the flower fairy costumes , and based each on the flowers and leaves of the particular plant to be illustrated . the costumes were kept in a trunk in her studio along with wings made of twigs and gauze . each was broken down after an illustration was completed and the parts recycled for other costumes . she often referred to dion clayton calthrop \\'s english costume . \\n  = = = middle years = = = \\n  in the late 1920s , barker began to doubt she was doing enough for the church and considered focusing solely on sacred works . family and friends recommended she continue secular and sacred works , which she did . \\n  barker continued to attend evening classes at the croydon art school between the 1920s and the 1940s , eventually receiving a teaching position . she took sketching trips to amberley and storrington in sussex and to cornwall and the southern coast with family and friends . she visited and stayed with artist margaret tarrant in gomshall , surrey and with family in ugglebarnby , near whitby , north yorkshire . \\n  in 1940 , the barker \\'s live @-@ in maid retired , and dorothy barker closed her school at the back of the house in the waldrons . she continued to supervise the household , and to give both her mother and sister the care they needed . dorothy and her sister collaborated upon only two books : our darling \\'s first book and the christian @-@ themed , he leadeth me . in 1954 dorothy barker died of a heart attack . barker was unable to pursue her art to any significant extent following her sister \\'s death , as all the care of her aged mother devolved upon her , but she did manage to begin planning a stained glass window design

greenaway \\'s children do , though barker \\'s children are less melancholy and less flat in appearance , due perhaps to advances in printing technology . barker studied flowers with an analytical eye and was friend to children \\'s illustrator , margaret tarrant . along with greenaway , illustrator alice b. woodward also influenced barker \\'s work . \\n  the pre @-@ raphaelites were a strong , lifelong influence on barker . she once indicated , \" i am to some extent influenced by them — not in any technical sense , but in the choice of subject matter and the feeling and atmosphere they

genus dasyatis , noting that it belonged to the \" maskray \" species group that also included the bluespotted stingray ( then dasyatis kuhlii ) . in 2008 , last and william white elevated the kuhlii group to the rank of full genus as neotrygon , on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic evidence . \\n  in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna , the plain maskray and the ningaloo maskray ( n. ningalooensis ) were found to be the most basal members of neotrygon . the divergence of the n. annotata lineage was estimated to have occurred ~ 54 ma . furthermore , the individuals sequenced in the study sorted into two genetically distinct clades , suggesting that n. annotata is a cryptic species complex . the two putative species were estimated to have diverged ~ 4 @.@ 9 ma ; the precipitating event was likely the splitting of the ancestral population by coastline changes . \\n  = = description = = \\n  the pectoral fin disc of the plain maskray is thin and diamond @-@ shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners , measuring 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 3 times longer than wide . the leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout . the small eyes are placed close together , and behind them are the spiracles . the nostrils are elongated and have a skirt @-@ shaped flap of skin between them . the small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor . small papillae are also found around the outside of the mouth . there are five pairs of gill slits . the pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed . \\n  the tail is short , barely exceeding the length of the disc when intact , and has a broad and flattened base leading to usually two stinging spines . after the stings , the tail becomes slender and bears a long ventral fin fold and a much shorter , lower dorsal fin fold . most of the body lacks dermal denticles ; a midline row of 4 – 13 small , closely spaced thorns is present behind the spiracles , and another row of 0 – 4 thorns before the stings . the dorsal coloration is grayish green , becoming pinkish towards the disc margins ; there is a dark mask @-@ like shape around the eyes and a pair of small dark blotches behind the spiracles . the tail behind the stings has alternating black and white bands of variable width , ending with black at the tip . the underside is plain white and the ventral fin fold is light grayish in color . this species grows to 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) across and 45 cm ( 18 in ) long . \\n  = = distribution and habitat = = \\n  the plain maskray inhabits the continental shelf of northern australia from the wellesley islands in queensland to the bonaparte archipelago in western australia , including the gulf of carpentaria and the timor and arafura seas . there are unsubstantiated reports that its range extends to southern papua new guinea . it is the least common of the several maskray species native to the region . this species is a bottom @-@ dweller that prefers habitats with fine sediment . it has been recorded from between 12 and 62 m ( 39 and 203 ft ) deep , and tends to be found farther away from shore than other maskrays in its range . \\n  = = biology and ecology = = \\n  the plain maskray generally hunts at the surface of the bottom substrate , rather than digging for prey . its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms . small bony fishes are also eaten , along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod . larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays . this species is parasitized by the tapeworm acanthobothrium jonesi . \\n  like other stingrays , the plain maskray is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) produced by the mother . mature females have a single functional ovary and uterus , on the left . litter size is one or two ; the newborns measure 12 – 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) across . males and females reach sexual maturity at disc widths of 20 – 21 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 – 8 @.@ 3 in ) and 18 – 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) respectively . the maximum lifespan is estimated to be 9 years for males and 13 years for females . \\n  = = human interactions = = \\n  the main conservation threat to the plain maskray is incidental capture by commercial bottom trawl fisheries . in the present day , this is mostly caused by australia \\'s northern prawn fishery , which operates throughout its range . although this species is discarded when caught , it is more delicate @-@ bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear . historically , this species may also have been negatively affected by japanese , chinese , and taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern australia from 1959 to 1990 . these factors , coupled with the plain maskray \\'s limited distribution and low reproductive rate , have resulted in its being assessed as near threatened by the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) . \\n  = 2011 – 12 columbus blue jackets season = \\n  the 2011 – 12 columbus blue jackets season was the team \\'s 12th season in the national hockey league ( nhl ) . the blue jackets \\' record of 29 – 46 – 7 [ note 1 ] was the worst record in the nhl for 2011 – 12 and the first time in franchise history they finished in last place . it also marked the third straight year that they missed the playoffs . consequently , they had the best chance to receive the first overall selection in the 2012 nhl entry draft lottery , but lost out to the edmonton oilers and received the second pick instead . \\n  the blue jackets began the year with the worst start in franchise history and the worst by any team in an nhl season in 19 years . after an 11 – 25 – 5 start , head coach scott arniel was fired and replaced by assistant coach todd richards . the poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of all @-@ star forward jeff carter , who was acquired with much fanfare during the off @-@ season . with the prospect of another rebuild looming the blue jackets \\' captain and best player , rick nash , requested to be traded , though he would remain with the team for the entire season . \\n  the team was involved in a controversial loss to the los angeles kings , when the staples center clock appeared to freeze at 1 @.@ 8 seconds allowing the kings time to score the tying goal , before winning in overtime . during the season columbus managed only two winning streaks of three or more games . one of which came towards the end of the year helping the blue jackets finish with 65 points , the third worst point total in franchise history . \\n  = = off @-@ season = = \\n  in the off @-@ season the blue jackets \\' approach to building their team changed , moving from a team of young developing players into one with established players . the first deal general manager scott howson made was the acquisition of all @-@ star forward jeff carter on june 23 , 2011 . the deal sent jakub voracek , columbus \\' first @-@ round draft choice , the eighth overall , and their third @-@ round pick in the 2011 draft to the philadelphia flyers in exchange for carter . the trade received a positive response in columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player , rick nash . next , they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent james wisniewski . wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010 – 11 season , splitting time between the new york islanders and montreal canadiens . the point total was fifth @-@ highest in the league for defenseman scoring , tying tobias enstrom . the blue jackets came to terms with wisniewski , just an hour prior to the start of free agency , signing him to a six @-@ year , $ 33 million deal . \\n  columbus also traded former first round draft pick nikita filatov to the ottawa senators for a third @-@ round pick in the 2011 draft . filatov had failed to live up to expectations in columbus , playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals . prior to the start of the season , the blue jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran back @-@ up to starting goaltender steve mason , as the former calder memorial trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons . the blue jackets signed mark dekanich as the back @-@ up who had only 50 minutes of nhl experience prior to the start of the season . columbus did sign a veteran curtis sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their american hockey league ( ahl ) affiliate , the springfield falcons . sanford had not played in the nhl since 2009 . during training camp , dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line @-@ up for a month . additionally , sanford suffered a groin injury , leaving allen york as the back @-@ up . york had only played four professional games , all in the ahl , entering the season . \\n  = = regular season = = \\n  = = = october – december = = = \\n  after the first five games , all losses , jeff carter suffered a broken foot that kept him out of the line @-@ up for 10 games . while carter was injured , the blue jackets continued to lose games . in the eighth game of the year , they had a chance to end the losing streak against the ottawa senators . columbus held a 3 – 2 lead with under a minute to play . jason spezza tied the game on a late power play , and with just 4 @.@ 7 seconds remaining , milan michalek notched the winning goal for the senators . the loss helped set a franchise record for futility with a 0 – 7 – 1 record to start a season . [ note 1 ] the losing streak came to an end three days later with a win over the detroit red wings . during the game , several milestones were reached . james wisniewski made his columbus debut , ryan johansen and john moore scored their first career nhl goals and grant clitsome had a career @-@ high three assists . columbus was unable to create any momentum from the win , however , and continued to struggle , culminating in a 2 – 12 – 1 record , which was the worst start to an nhl season for any team in 19 years . with the team struggling , management attempted to \" shake things up \" by making some roster moves . the first move was the acquisition of center mark letestu from the pittsburgh penguins . next , they traded defenseman kris russell to the st. louis blues for nikita nikitin . as the clubs slow start continued , there were rumors that head coach scott arniel would be fired and replaced with ken hitchcock . hitchcock had previously coached the blue jackets to their only playoff appearance in club history and was still under contract with the franchise through to the end of the season . before any of these rumors came to fruition , the st. louis blues asked columbus for permission to hire hitchcock , which the blue jackets allowed . hitchcock began his blues coaching career with a 6 – 1 – 2 record in his first nine games , while columbus amassed a 6 – 13 – 3 record to start the season . \\n  during the same time frame as the hitchcock rumors , goaltender curtis sanford returned from his groin injury on november 13 . he made his first start of the season against the boston bruins , losing 2 – 1 in a shootout . sanford continued his strong play , posting a 3 – 1 – 2 record , 1 @.@ 38 goals against average and .947 save percentage over his next six games . sanford started 12 consecutive games before steve mason made his next start . the number of starts might not have been as numerous , but prior to the november 23 game , mason was hit in the head by a shot from rick nash during pre @-@ game warm @-@ ups and suffered a concussion . mason returned from his concussion after two games , making a start against the vancouver canucks . mason allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from cramping in the third period , temporarily being replaced by sanford for just over three minutes . columbus won the game 2 – 1 in a shootout , breaking a nine @-@ game losing streak to the canucks . after the game , arniel stated that sanford was still seen as the team \\'s number one goaltender . however , mason started four of the next six games with the blue jackets going 0 – 5 – 1 during that stretch . \\n  = = = january – february = = = \\n  with the losing continuing , more rumors began to surface . unlike before , the rumors were about player moves rather than coaching changes . the majority of rumors were that the blue jackets would trade rick nash . while howson stated that he had never brought up trading nash in discussions , other teams had inquired about his availability . nash stated that if columbus felt it would make the franchise better than he would be willing to waive his no @-@ trade clause . howson publicly stated that he had no intention of trading nash . more rumors came to light when reports attributed to réseau des sports stated that carter was unhappy in columbus and demanded a trade . howson , carter and his agent all denied that a trade request was ever made , and they were unsure where the reports were coming from . with the trade deadline approaching , speculation picked up on the blue jackets trading carter . reports were that columbus was trying to trade carter and that he was \" 100 percent available . \" \\n  at the halfway point of the season , with the blue jackets barely into double digit wins with an 11 – 25 – 5 record , worst in the league , and sitting 20 points out of playoff position , columbus fired arniel . he was replaced by assistant coach todd richards on an interim basis . richards had previously coached the minnesota wild . he recorded his first coaching victory for the blue jackets in his second game , a 4 – 3 win over the phoenix coyotes . the change in coaching did not change the fortunes of the team , as they reached the all @-@ star break with a 13 – 30 – 6 record . at the break , blue jackets \\' owner john p. mcconnell sent out a letter to fans stating his understanding of their frustration . he added that action would be taken around the trade deadline , the entry draft and free agency to take the team in a new direction . when speaking of the season , mcconnell stated \" disappointing is not a strong enough word \" and that he was committed to giving fans a team of which they can be proud of . he also thanked them for their dedication and passion , while reiterating that the team goal was to \" win consistently and compete for the stanley cup . \" days later , a 250 @-@ person protest occurred outside of nationwide arena . fans were upset with the blue jackets \\' management and were calling for changes at the top . the same day the fans protested , it was announced that the franchise would host the 2013 all @-@ star game . columbus was without a representative for the 2012 all @-@ star game , but ryan johansen represented the club as a rookie participant in the super skills competition . in the competition , johansen participated in the allstate insurance nhl breakaway challenge , a shootout themed event judged by the fans . he received just 1 % of the vote and finished last . \\n  following the break , the blue jackets were on the road playing the los angeles kings , and with the score tied late in the game , kings \\' defenseman drew doughty scored with just 0 @.@ 4 seconds remaining to win the game . upon review of the goal it , was determined that the clock at staples center froze at 1 @.@ 8 seconds for over a full second , which would have resulted in time expiring prior to the goal being scored . kings \\' general manager dean lombardi stated that the clock was correct and no extra time had been added due to the way the clock self @-@ corrects at various times . howson stated on the team \\'s blog that \" it is an amazing coincidence that with the kings on a power play at staples center and with a mad scramble around our net in the dying seconds of the third period of a 2 – 2 hockey game that the clock stopped for at least one full second , \" adding that , \" either there was a deliberate stopping of the clock or the clock malfunctioned . \" nhl senior vice president of hockey operations colin campbell stated that the blue jackets were wronged , but that the outcome of the game could not be changed , and that the delay was not noticed by the off @-@ ice officials or the situation room in toronto . to determine the true cause of the clock pause , the nhl launched an investigation , talking with the clock \\'s manufacturer and interviewing staples center staff . \\n  two weeks prior to the nhl trade deadline , columbus announced that unlike earlier in the season , they would listen to trade proposals involving rick nash , though they were not actively shopping him . howson stated that the team was open to all options for improving the team , including trading nash . speculation was that in return for nash the blue jackets would ask for a \" combination of young , proven players , high @-@ end prospects and draft picks . \" leading up to the trade deadline , the blue jackets dealt antoine vermette to the phoenix coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender curtis mcelhinney . despite being injured at the time , the acquisition of mcelhinney was believed to give columbus the flexibility to trade curtis sanford . the following day , on february 23 , columbus traded jeff carter to the kings . in the deal , columbus acquired defenseman jack johnson and a first @-@ round draft pick ; the team was given the choice of taking the pick in either 2012 or 2013 . at the deadline , columbus was unable to come to terms on a deal involving nash , but they did make one more move ; they sent center samuel pahlsson to the vancouver canucks in exchange for two fourth @-@ round draft picks and minor league defenseman taylor ellington . following the trade deadline , howson announced that the team had attempted to trade nash at the player \\'s request . nash stated that he had requested the trade after being informed that the franchise was going into another rebuilding phase . he further noted that he felt that he \" could be a huge part of that towards bringing assets in , \" and in his view \" it was the best thing for the team , the organization , and personally for [ his ] career . \" after the personnel changes , the blue jackets closed out the month with a three @-@ game losing streak . \\n  = = = march – april = = = \\n  columbus started march with a 2 – 0 shutout against the colorado avalanche . they proceeded to win their next game against the phoenix coyotes 5 – 2 , which marked the first time that the blue jackets posted back @-@ to @-@ back regulation victories during the season . columbus again defeated the coyotes three days later to earn their first three @-@ game win streak of the season . they extended the streak to four with a win over the los angeles kings before it came to an end with a 4 – 1 loss to the st. louis blues . it was the only four @-@ game win streak of the season for the blue jackets . they immediately matched their four @-@ game win streak with a four @-@ game losing streak and with ten games remaining , the blue jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention . shortly after being eliminated , they were defeated by the edmonton oilers 6 – 3 ; the loss clinched last place in the nhl for columbus . it was the first time in franchise history the blue jackets finished in 30th place . \\n  three days later , on march 28 , goaltender steve mason was injured in the morning skate when a shot from colton gillies hit him in the mask . with sanford again injured , york made an emergency start . playing against the detroit red wings , york made 29 saves , including 17 in the third period , helping columbus to a 4 – 2 victory and giving york his first career nhl win . york remained the starter and led the blue jackets to a second three @-@ game winning streak . in his fourth start , columbus was shutout by the coyotes despite a franchise @-@ record 54 shots on goal , losing 2 – 0 . the 54 saves by phoenix goaltender mike smith set an nhl record for a regulation shutout . mason returned to the starter \\'s role for the final two games , winning both . the two victories gave columbus 65 points for the year , their third @-@ lowest total in franchise history . \\n  the blue jackets struggled in shorthanded situations , allowing the most power @-@ play goals in the league , with 64 , and having the lowest penalty @-@ kill percentage ,

number one draft pick for a third consecutive year . it was the fifth time that the blue jackets were dropped one draft position in the franchise \\'s 12 lottery participations . \\n  a month later , on may 14 , the blue jackets announced that richards would remain as head coach and signed him to a two @-@ year contract . during the press conference , howson noted , \" our team continuously

= gregorian tower = \\n  the gregorian tower ( italian : torre gregoriana ) or tower of the winds ( italian : torre dei venti ) is a round tower located above the gallery of maps , which connects the villa belvedere with the apostolic palace in vatican city . the tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by the bolognese architect ottaviano mascherino ( who was credited with building the apostolic palace ) mainly to promote the study of astronomy for the gregorian calendar reform which was commissioned by pope gregory xiii and promulgated in 1582 . it was then also known as the tower of winds . the tower is now called the \" specola astronomica vaticana \" , the vatican observatory . four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established . the tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a sundial as they provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the julian calendar . \\n  = = early history = = \\n  the first stage of building of the tower , as recorded by leo xiii in his motu proprio ut mysticam of 1891 , is credited to pope gregory xiii , pope from 1572 to 1585 . the directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the vatican and equip it with the \" greatest and best instruments of the time \" . the design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the julian calendar , in use since 45 bc , to verify their proposed reforms . fr . christoph clavius , a jesuit mathematician from the roman college , was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations . the 73 metres ( 240 ft ) tower was then built above the museum and library , flanked by the belvedere and della pigna courtyards . the instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a meridian line designed by ignazio danti of perugia . it was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre , embellished with scientific designs . the tower still remains today , but has undergone improvements over the centuries . \\n  = = second stage = = \\n  the second stage of construction in the 17th and 18th centuries , when the tower was under the charge of the vatican librarian , involved mgr . filippo luigi gilii , a clergyman of st. peter \\'s basilica . earlier in 1797 , pius vi gave approval to placing a latin inscription specula vaticana at the entrance to the upper part of the tower , which was implemented by cardinal zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower \\'s observatory . the original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of pope pius vi . its instrumentation , apart from many normal devices ( such as meteorological and magnetic equipment , with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock , ) was noted for the dolland telescope . the instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse , appearance of comets , satellites of jupiter and mercury ’ s transit . as an addition , under the patronage of pope pius x , four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) long fortification walls , more than a thousand years old . mgr . gilii , highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics , biology , archeology and the hebrew language , was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821 . he carried out continuous meteorological observations ( twice a day at 6 am and 2 pm ) conforming to the programme of the mannheim meteorological society . while the observation records for seven years were published , the balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in the vatican library . subsequent to gilii \\'s death in 1821 , the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the roman college . established in 1787 , it was considered more suitable for making observations than the vatican . \\n  = = third stage = = \\n  the revival of the observatory on the gregorian tower was initiated by the barnabite francesco denza with the approval of pope leo xiii . high quality instruments were procured , partly with generous donations from hicks of london , and the automatic recording instruments were procured from richard in paris . a four @-@ inch equatorial , a three @-@ inch transit instrument , and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers , were also procured from the observatory at modena . in 1888 , the gift of a 16 inch long telescope to pope leo xiii , became a part of the observatory . father denza joined the observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments . the same year , a second tower was built some 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) away from the main gregorian tower , overlooking the vatican gardens behind st. peter \\'s basilica on the south @-@ west border . it was built to a diameter of 17 metres ( 56 ft ) with a lower wall thickness of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) , which could bear the load of a 13 inch photographic refractor , newly procured from paris . augustinian father rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from 1898 to 1905 . in 1891 , pope leo xiii , promulgating the motu proprio ut mysticam , designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established vatican observatory , a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations . \\n  = = fourth stage = = \\n  the fourth stage involved remedying the problem of communicating between the two towers during the time of pope pius x. his plans were to make the gregorian tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a 83 metres ( 272 ft ) iron bridge spanning the gap . at the west end of this bridge , a four @-@ inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion . the east end of the bridge , above the barracks of the gendarmes , had a heliograph , with a camera attached , used to photograph the sun ( photoheliograph ) . a new 16 @-@ inch visual telescope , called torre pio x , was erected in the second tower . as a result of these modifications , the original library was moved to the pontifical academy lincei , and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the valle di pompei observatory . the new astronomical library was housed in two rooms of the building . the two new repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates . the recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars . charts were printed on silver bromide paper . \\n  = = features = = \\n  the tower had two floors and a mezzanine . on the first floor was the famous sundial room or meridian room , which was initially an open loggia . pope urban viii had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by simon lagi and the two flemish artists paul and matthijs bril . today the tower has paintings by cristoforo roncalli and matteino da siena . \\n  the sundial room , also called the meridian hall , was once the residence of queen christina of sweden , then newly converted to catholicism . the room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name : a sundial , and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to the ceiling of the meridian hall . these were created by ignazio danti , the papal cosmographer , in association with the gregorian calendar reform . the sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north @-@ south

runner named fingal by the confederacy after she made one run to savannah , georgia . after several failed attempts to attack union blockaders , the ship was captured by two union monitors in 1863 when she ran aground . atlanta was floated off , repaired , and rearmed , serving in the union navy for the rest of the war . she spent most of her time deployed on the james river supporting union forces there . the ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve . several years after the end of the war , atlanta was sold to haiti , but was lost at sea in december 1869 on her delivery voyage . \\n  = = description and career as fingal = = \\n  fingal was designed and built as a merchantman by j & g thomson \\'s clyde bank iron shipyard at govan in glasgow , scotland , and was completed early in 1861 . she was described by midshipman dabney scales , who served on the atlanta before her battle with the monitors , as being a two @-@ masted , iron @-@ hulled ship 189 feet ( 57 @.@ 6 m ) long with a beam of 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) . she had a draft of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) and a depth of hold of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) . he estimated her tonnage at around 700 tons bm . fingal was equipped with two vertical single @-@ cylinder direct @-@ acting steam engines using steam generated by one flue @-@ tubular boiler . the engines drove the ship at a top speed of around 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . they had a bore of 39 inches ( 991 mm ) and a stroke of 30 inches ( 762 mm ) . \\n  the ship briefly operated between glasgow and other ports in scotland for hutcheson \\'s west highland service before she was purchased in september 1861 by james d. bulloch , the primary foreign agent in great britain for the confederacy , to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased . to disguise his control of fingal , and the destination of her cargo , bulloch hired an english crew and captain and put out his destination as bermuda and nassau in the bahamas . the cargo was loaded in greenock in early october , although bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at holyhead , wales . on the night 14 / 15 october , as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at holyhead , fingal rammed and sank the austrian brig siccardi , slowly swinging at anchor without lights . bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while bulloch dispatched a letter to his financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig \\'s owners because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the affair lest he and fingal be detained . the ship reached bermuda on 2 november and , after leaving port on 7 november , bulloch informed the crew that the steamer \\'s real destination was savannah , georgia ; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to nassau . however , all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the union blockade . fingal was able slip safely into the savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 november without sighting any blockaders . \\n  while fingal was discharging her cargo , bulloch went to richmond to confer with stephen mallory , secretary of the navy . mallory endorsed bulloch \\'s plan to load fingal with cotton to sell on the navy department \\'s account to be used to purchase more ships and equipment in europe . he returned to savannah on 23 november and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal . he made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 december , but it proved impossible to do as the union controlled every channel from savannah , aided by their occupation of tybee island at the mouth of the savannah river . bulloch reported to mallory in late january 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to europe some other way . \\n  = = as atlanta = = \\n  the brothers asa and nelson tift received the contract to convert the blockade runner into an ironclad in early 1862 with the name of atlanta , after the city in georgia . this was largely financed by contributions from the women of savannah . fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from the sides of her hull to support her casemate . after the conversion , atlanta was 204 feet ( 62 @.@ 2 m ) long overall and had a beam of 41 feet ( 12 m ) . her depth of hold was now 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) and she now had a draft of 15 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 8 m ) . atlanta now displaced 1 @,@ 006 long tons ( 1 @,@ 022 t ) and her speed was estimated at 7 – 10 knots ( 13 – 19 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 5 mph ) . \\n  the armor of the casemate was angled at 30 ° from the horizontal and made from two layers of railroad rails , rolled into plates 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick and 7 inches ( 180 mm ) wide . the outer layer ran vertically and the inner layer horizontally . her armor was backed by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of oak , vertically oriented , and two layers of 7 @.@ 5 inches ( 191 mm ) of pine , alternating in direction . the bottom of the casemate was some 20 inches ( 508 mm ) from the waterline and its top was 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) above the waterline . the pyramidal pilothouse was armored in the same way and had room for two men . the upper portion of atlanta \\'s hull received two inches of armor . \\n  the rectangular casemate was pierced with eight narrow gun ports , one each at the bow and stern and three along each side . each gun port was protected by an armored shutter made of two layers of iron riveted together and allowed the guns to elevate only to a maximum of + 5 to + 7 ° . atlanta was armed with single @-@ banded , 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) brooke rifles on pivot mounts at the bow and stern . the middle gun port on each side was occupied by a single @-@ banded , 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 163 mm ) brooke rifle . the 17 @-@ caliber , seven @-@ inch guns weighed about 15 @,@ 000 pounds ( 6 @,@ 800 kg ) and fired 80 @-@ pound ( 36 kg ) armor @-@ piercing \" bolts \" and 110 @-@ pound ( 50 kg ) explosive shells . the equivalent statistics for the 18 @.@ 5 @-@ caliber , 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch gun were 9 @,@ 110 pounds ( 4 @,@ 130 kg ) with 80 @-@ pound bolts and 64 @-@ pound ( 29 kg ) shells . atlanta was also armed with a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) , solid iron , ram that was reinforced by a series of vertical steel bars . in front of the ram was a spar torpedo that carried 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) of black powder on a wooden pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys . \\n  on 31 july 1862 , under the command of lieutenant charles h. mcblair , atlanta conducted her sea trials down the savannah river toward fort pulaski . the ship proved to be difficult to steer , and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft . this latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near savannah . she also leaked significantly , and her design virtually eliminated air circulation . one report said that \" it was almost intolerable on board the atlanta , there being no method of ventilation , and the heat was intense . \" scales commented in his diary , \" what a comfortless , infernal and god @-@ forsaken ship ! ! \" \\n  attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks . the ship was commissioned on 22 november and became the flagship of flag officer josiah tattnall , commander of the naval defenses of georgia . under pressure from mallory to engage the blockading ships , tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 january 1863 , but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner , despite early coordination being made by tattnall to do so . it took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived before the end of january . nonetheless tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 february , but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so . after atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 march , tattnall planned to attack the union base at port royal , south carolina while the monitors were attacking charleston . deserters revealed tatnall \\'s plan while he was waiting at the head of wassaw sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at port royal . dissatisfied with tattnall \\'s perceived lack of aggressiveness , mallory replaced tattnall as commander of the savannah squadron later that month with commander richard l. page . page , in his turn was relieved in may by commander william a. webb ; atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time . \\n  webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sortie on the first spring tide ( 30 may ) after taking command , but atlanta \\'s forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions , and the ship ran aground . she was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free . he planned to make another attempt on the next full tide , rejecting mallory \\'s idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad savannah was finished before his next sortie . in the meantime , rear admiral samuel f. du pont , commander of the south atlantic blockading squadron , had ordered the monitors weehawken and nahant into wassaw sound . commander john rodgers in weehawken had overall command of the two ships . \\n  in the early evening of 15 june , webb began his next attempt by passing over the lower obstructions in the wilmington river and spent the rest of the night coaling . he moved forward the next evening to a concealed position within easy reach of the monitors for an attack early the following morning . webb planned to sink one of the monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with the other one with his guns . the gunboat isondiga and the tugboat resolute were to accompany him to tow one or both of the monitors back to savannah . \\n  a lookout aboard weehawken spotted atlanta at 04 : 10 on the morning of 17 june . when the latter ship closed to within about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) of the two union ships , she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over weehawken and landed near nahant . shortly afterward , atlanta ran aground on a sandbar ; she was briefly able to free herself , but the pressure of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar . this time webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range . when weehawken , the leading ship , closed to within 200 – 300 yards ( 180 – 270 m ) she opened fire with both of her guns . the 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) shell missed , but the 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port , penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it , spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun , even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing . the next shot from the 11 @-@ inch dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two @-@ inch armor there . the next shell from the 15 @-@ inch dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened , wounding half the gun \\'s crew with fragments . the final shell was also from the 15 @-@ inch dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse , breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it . by this time , atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots , none of which hit either union ship , and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half . weehawken and nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the atlanta \\'s narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile . webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire , before nahant even had a chance to fire . of the ironclad \\'s 21 officers and 124 enlisted men , one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization . \\n  = = in the union navy = = \\n  atlanta was easily pulled free by the union ships and she reached port royal under her own power . not badly damaged , she was repaired and bought by the union navy . the prize money of $ 350 @,@ 000 was shared between the crews of weehawken , nahant and the gunboat cimarron , the only ships within signaling distance . the ship retained her name and was commissioned again on 2 february 1864 , rearmed with a pair of 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) , 150 @-@ pound parrott rifles in the bow and stern and 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch , 100 @-@ pound parrott rifles amidships . the 150 @-@ pound parrott rifle weighed 16 @,@ 500 pounds ( 7 @,@ 500 kg ) and was 17 calibers long . the 100 @-@ pounder weighed 9 @,@ 800 pounds ( 4 @,@ 400 kg ) and was 20 calibers long . it fired a 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shell a distance of 6 @,@ 900 yards ( 6 @,@ 300 m ) at an elevation of + 25 ° . all four of her brooke rifles are currently located in willard park in the washington navy yard . atlanta was assigned to the north atlantic blockading squadron and spent most of her time stationed up the james river where she could support operations against richmond and defend against a sortie by the ironclads of the james river squadron . on 21 may 1864 , she and the gunboat dawn fired on and dispersed confederate cavalry that was attacking fort powhatan and she was deployed further upriver in february 1865 after the battle of trent \\'s reach to better blockade the confederate ironclads at richmond . \\n  after the end of the war in april , atlanta was decommissioned in philadelphia on 21 june 1865 and placed in reserve at league island . she was sold to sam ward on 4 may 1869 for the price of $ 25 @,@ 000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of haiti on 8 december by sydney oaksmith , a lawyer who had received an advance of $ 50 @,@ 000 on her purchase price of $ 260 @,@ 000 . the ship was briefly seized by the customs service , possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of sylvain salnave , president of haiti , who was embroiled in a civil war . atlanta was released and sailed for port @-@ au @-@ prince three days later . she broke down in delaware bay and had to put in at chester , pennsylvania for repairs . the ship , now renamed either triumph or triumfo , departed on 18 december 1869 and vanished en route , apparently sinking with the loss of all hands , either off cape hatteras or the delaware capes . \\n  = jacqueline fernandez = \\n  jacqueline fernandez ( born 11 august 1985 ) is a sri lankan actress , former model , and the winner of the

samuelsson and grant jennings . the penguins almost turned down the deal as they were concerned about giving up cullen \\'s playmaking and leadership abilities , while his former teammates credited cullen as being the primary reason they were in a playoff position at the time the trade happened . after the penguins won their first stanley cup that season , phil bourque later said it \" broke his heart \" that cullen was not able to share in that championship . \\n  in hartford , cullen worked to overcome the team \\'s fans \\' disappointment at losing francis . the hartford fans initially booed him to show their dissatisfaction with the trade . he scored 16 points in 13 regular season games to finish the season with 110 points combined between the penguins and whalers , and was the team \\'s best player in their first round loss to the boston bruins in the 1991 stanley cup playoffs . he initially accepted an invitation to join the canadian team at the 1991 canada cup , but

cullen was excited to play for his father \\'s old team , but injuries reduced his ability to perform . his most significant injury was a herniated disc in his neck that doctors initially feared would end his career . a bulky neck brace allowed cullen to return and play out his contract in toronto . when the leafs chose not to re @-@ sign him following the 1993 – 94 season , he returned to the

season as he continued to battle the disease , while his teammates wore a uniform patch with his # 12 in support throughout the year . \\n  on one day during his treatments , as his wife was wheeling him down a hospital corridor , cullen went into cardiac arrest , requiring doctors to use a defibrillator to revive him . he underwent a bone marrow transplant that briefly reduced his immune system to the point that he could have very little human contact . another examination in april 1998 revealed that the cancer was finally gone , and cullen immediately began training for a comeback . \\n  the lightning signed cullen to a one @-@ year , $ 500 @,@ 000 contract for the 1998 – 99 season . he played his first game in nearly 18 months on september 18 , 1998 , in an exhibition game between

the lightning \\'s first eight games , but it was evident that he had lost much of his speed and strength . the lightning assigned him to the ihl \\'s cleveland lumberjacks , but also gave him the option of retiring and taking up a position as an assistant coach . he chose to accept the demotion , giving himself one month to determine if he could continue playing . he appeared in six games for cleveland , and in one game against the chicago wolves tied an ihl record when he scored seven points in a 7 – 3 victory . \\n  however , a bout of bronchitis led cullen to fear that his cancer had returned . tests came back negative , but after spending time with his family , he realized that neither he nor his family were interested in returning to cleveland . cullen announced his retirement on november 28 , 1998 , and accepted the lightning offer to become an assistant coach . in recognition of his comeback attempt , the nhl named him the 1999 winner of the bill masterton memorial trophy for dedication and perseverance , while the ihl renamed its comeback player of the year award the john cullen award . \\n  former lightning head coach terry crisp has stated publicly that cullen was a

= ancient egyptian deities = \\n  ancient egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient egypt . the beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient egyptian religion , which emerged sometime in prehistory . deities represented natural forces and phenomena , and the egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat , or divine order . after the founding of the egyptian state around 3100 bc , the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh , who claimed to be the gods \\' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out . \\n  the gods \\' complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities : family ties , loose groups and hierarchies , and combinations of separate gods into one . deities \\' diverse appearances in art — as animals , humans , objects , and combinations of different forms — also alluded , through symbolism , to their essential features . \\n  in different eras , various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society , including the solar deity ra , the mysterious god amun , and the mother goddess isis . the highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life @-@ giving power of the sun . some scholars have argued , based in part on egyptian writings , that the egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities . yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world , except possibly during the era of atenism in the 14th century bc , when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god aten . \\n  gods were assumed to be present throughout the world , capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives . people interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines , for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites . egyptians prayed for divine help , used rituals to compel deities to act , and called upon them for advice . humans \\' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of egyptian society . \\n  = = definition = = \\n  the beings in ancient egyptian tradition who might be labeled as deities are difficult to count . egyptian texts list the names of many deities whose nature is unknown and make vague , indirect references to other gods who are not even named . the egyptologist james p. allen estimates that more than 1 @,@ 400 deities are named in egyptian texts , whereas his colleague christian leitz says there are \" thousands upon thousands \" of gods . \\n  the egyptian language \\'s terms for these beings were nṯr , \" god \" , and its feminine form nṯrt , \" goddess \" . scholars have tried to discern the original nature of the gods by proposing etymologies for these words , but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance , and the terms \\' origin remains obscure . the hieroglyphs that were used as ideograms and determinatives in writing these words show some of the traits that the egyptians connected with divinity . the most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole . similar objects were placed at the entrances of temples , representing the presence of a deity , throughout ancient egyptian history . other such hieroglyphs include a falcon , reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons , and a seated male or female deity . the feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative , connecting goddesses with creation and birth , or with a cobra , reflecting the use of the cobra to depict many female deities . \\n  the egyptians distinguished nṯrw , \" gods \" , from rmṯ , \" people \" , but the meanings of the egyptian and the english terms do not match perfectly . the term nṯr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life . deceased humans were called nṯr because they were considered to be like the gods , whereas the term was rarely applied to many of egypt \\'s lesser supernatural beings , which modern scholars often call \" demons \" . egyptian religious art also depicts places , objects , and concepts in human form . these personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings , only mentioned once or twice , that may be little more than metaphors . \\n  confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings , scholars have proposed various definitions of a \" deity \" . one widely accepted definition , suggested by jan assmann , says that a deity has a cult , is involved in some aspect of the universe , and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition . according to a different definition , by dimitri meeks , nṯr applied to any being that was the focus of ritual . from this perspective , \" gods \" included the king , who was called a god after his coronation rites , and deceased souls , who entered the divine realm through funeral ceremonies . likewise , the preeminence of the great gods was maintained by the ritual devotion that was performed for them across egypt . \\n  = = origins = = \\n  the first written evidence of deities in egypt comes from the early dynastic period ( c . 3100 – 2686 bc ) . deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding predynastic period ( before 3100 bc ) and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs . predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures . some of these images , such as stars and cattle , are reminiscent of important features of egyptian religion in later times , but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities . as egyptian society grew more sophisticated , clearer signs of religious activity appeared . the earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era , along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities : the falcon that represents horus and several other gods , the crossed arrows that stand for neith , and the enigmatic \" set animal \" that represents set . \\n  many egyptologists and anthropologists have suggested theories about how the gods developed in these early times . gustave jéquier , for instance , thought the egyptians first revered primitive fetishes , then deities in animal form , and finally deities in human form , whereas henri frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning . some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic , and more current ones , such as siegfried morenz \\' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment , are difficult to prove . \\n  predynastic egypt originally consisted of small , independent villages . because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions , many scholars have suggested that the pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states , spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities . but others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were , like other elements of egyptian culture , present all across the country despite the political divisions within it . \\n  the final step in the formation of egyptian religion was the unification of egypt , in which rulers from upper egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country . these sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the exclusive right to interact with the gods , and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion . \\n  new gods continued to emerge after this transformation . some important deities like isis and amun are not known to have appeared until the old kingdom ( c . 2686 – 2181 bc ) . places and concepts could suddenly inspire the creation of a deity to represent them , and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite @-@ sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses . kings were said to be divine , although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths . some non @-@ royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly . this veneration was usually short @-@ lived , but the court architects imhotep and amenhotep son of hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes , as were some other officials . \\n  through contact with neighboring civilizations , the egyptians also adopted foreign deities . dedun , who is first mentioned in the old kingdom , may have come from nubia , and baal , anat , and astarte , among others , were adopted from canaanite religion during the new kingdom ( c . 1550 – 1070 bc ) . in greek and roman times , from 332 bc to the early centuries ad , deities from across the mediterranean world were revered in egypt , but the native gods remained , and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship . \\n  = = characteristics = = \\n  modern knowledge of egyptian beliefs about the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation \\'s scribes and priests . these people were the elite of egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace , most of whom were illiterate . little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed . commoners \\' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests . the populace may , for example , have mistaken the religion \\'s symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth . but overall , what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition . the two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature . \\n  = = = roles = = = \\n  most egyptian deities represent natural or social phenomena . the gods were generally said to be immanent in these phenomena — to be present within nature . the types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces . the god shu was the deification of all the world \\'s air ; the goddess meretseger oversaw a limited region of the earth , the theban necropolis ; and the god sia personified the abstract notion of perception . major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena . for instance , khnum was the god of elephantine island in the midst of the nile , the river that was essential to egyptian civilization . he was credited with producing the annual nile flood that fertilized the nation \\'s farmland . perhaps as an outgrowth of this life @-@ giving function , he was said to create all living things , fashioning their bodies on a potter \\'s wheel . gods could share the same role in nature ; ra , atum , khepri , horus , and other deities acted as sun gods . despite their diverse functions , most gods had an overarching role in common : maintaining maat , the universal order that was a central principle of egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess . but some deities represented disruption to maat . most prominently , apep was the force of chaos , constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe , and set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it . \\n  not all aspects of existence were seen as deities . although many deities were connected with the nile , no god personified it in the way that ra personified the sun . short @-@ lived phenomena , like rainbows or eclipses , were not represented by gods ; neither were elements like fire and water or many other components of the world . \\n  the roles of each deity were fluid , and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics . as a result , gods \\' roles are difficult to categorize or define . but despite their flexibility , the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence . not even the creator god could reach beyond the boundaries of the cosmos that he created , and even isis , though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods , was not omniscient . richard h. wilkinson , however , argues that some texts from the late new kingdom suggest that , as beliefs about the god amun evolved , he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not . \\n  the deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called \" minor divinities \" or \" demons \" in modern writing , although there is no firm definition for these terms . among these lesser deities , egyptologist claude traunecker draws a distinction between \" genies \" — specialized patron spirits of certain places , objects , or activities , such as the sea or marsh god wadj @-@ wer and the harvest goddess renenutet — and demons , who have a more dangerous character . many demons are hostile , causing illness and other troubles among humans . their power can also be protective ; they may guard certain places in the duat , the realm of the dead , or advise and watch over humans . egyptians believed the landscape was full of these unpredictable divine powers . demons often act as servants and messengers to the greater gods , but their position in the hierarchy is not fixed . the protective deities bes and taweret originally had minor , demon @-@ like roles , but over time they came to be credited with great influence . \\n  = = = behavior = = = \\n  divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature . except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order , the gods \\' actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things . they did this work using a force the egyptians called heka , a term usually translated as \" magic \" . heka was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves . \\n  the gods \\' actions in the present are described and praised in hymns and funerary texts . in contrast , mythology mainly concerns the gods \\' actions during a vaguely imagined past in which the gods were present on earth and interacted directly with humans . the events of this past time set the pattern for the events of the present . periodic occurrences were tied to events in the mythic past ; the succession of each new pharaoh , for instance , reenacted horus \\' accession to the throne of his father osiris . myths are metaphors for the gods \\' actions , which humans cannot fully understand . they contain seemingly contradictory ideas , each expressing a particular perspective on divine events . the contradictions in myth are part of the egyptians \\' many @-@ faceted approach to religious belief — what henri frankfort called a \" multiplicity of approaches \" to understanding the gods . \\n  in myth , the gods behave much like humans . they feel emotion ; they can eat , drink , fight , weep , sicken , and die . some have unique character traits . set is aggressive and impulsive , and thoth , patron of writing and knowledge , is prone to long @-@ winded speeches . yet overall , the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters . their behavior is inconsistent , and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated . most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots , because the symbolic meaning of the myths was more important than elaborate storytelling . \\n  the first divine act is the creation of the cosmos , described in several creation myths . they focus on different gods , each of which may act as creator deities . the eight gods of the ogdoad , who represent the chaos that precedes creation , give birth to the sun god , who establishes order in the newly formed world ; ptah , who embodies thought and creativity , gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them ; atum produces all things as emanations of himself ; and amun , according to the myths promoted by his priesthood , preceded and created the other creator gods . these and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory . each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos . the period following creation , in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society , is the setting for most myths . the gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of egypt to rule in their place . \\n  a recurring theme in these myths is the effort of the gods to maintain maat against the forces of disorder . they fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation . ra and apep , battling each other each night , continue this struggle into the present . another prominent theme is the gods \\' death and revival . the clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of osiris \\' murder , in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the duat . the sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky , sink into the duat at night , and emerge as a young child at dawn . in the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of primordial chaos . funerary texts that depict ra \\'s journey through the duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him . instead of being changelessly immortal , the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation , thus renewing the whole world . but it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return . some poorly understood egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen — that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world , leaving only himself and osiris amid the primordial chaos . \\n  = = = locations = = = \\n  gods were linked with specific regions of the universe . in egyptian tradition , the world includes the earth , the sky , and the duat . surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation . the gods in general were said to dwell in the sky , although gods whose roles were linked with other parts of the universe were said to live in those places instead . most events of mythology , set in a time before the gods \\' withdrawal from the human realm , take place in an earthly setting . the deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky . the duat , in contrast , is treated as a remote and inaccessible place , and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those in the world of the living . the space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant . it too is inhabited by deities , some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world . \\n  in the time after myth , most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world . temples were their main means of contact with humanity . each day , it was believed , the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples , their homes in the human world . there they inhabited the cult images , the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals . this movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth . as temples were the focal points of egyptian cities , the god in a city \\'s main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region . deities \\' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over . many gods had more than one cult center , and their local ties changed over time . they could establish themselves in new cities , or their range of influence could contract . therefore , a given deity \\'s main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin . the political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity . when kings from thebes took control of the country at start of the middle kingdom ( c . 2055 – 1650 bc ) , they elevated thebes \\' patron gods — first the war god montu and then amun — to national prominence . \\n  = = = names and epithets = = = \\n  in egyptian belief , names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer . in keeping with this belief , the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins . the name of the predatory goddess sekhmet means \" powerful one \" , the name of the mysterious god amun means \" hidden one \" , and the name of the goddess nekhbet , who was worshipped in the city of nekheb , means \" she of nekheb \" . but many other names have no certain meaning , even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role . the names of the sky goddess nut and the earth god geb do not resemble the egyptian terms for sky and earth . \\n  the egyptians also devised false etymologies giving more meanings to divine names . a passage in the coffin texts renders the name of the funerary god sokar as sk r , meaning \" cleaning of the mouth \" , to link his name with his role in the opening of the mouth ritual , while one in the pyramid texts says the name is based on words shouted by osiris , connecting sokar with the most important funerary deity . \\n  the gods were believed to have many names . among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others . to know the true name of a deity was to have power over it . the importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which isis poisons the superior god ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her . upon learning the name , she tells it to her son , horus , and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power . \\n  in addition to their names , gods were given epithets , like \" possessor of splendor \" , \" ruler of abydos \" , or \" lord of the sky \" , that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship . because of the gods \\' multiple and overlapping roles , deities can have many epithets — with more important gods accumulating more titles — and the same epithet can apply to many deities . some epithets eventually became separate deities , as with werethekau , an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning \" great enchantress \" , which came to be treated as an independent goddess . the host of divine names and titles expresses the gods \\' multifarious nature . \\n  = = = relationships = = = \\n  egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships . a god \\'s connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character . thus isis , as the mother and protector of horus , was a great healer as well as the patroness of kings . such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed . \\n  family relationships are a common type of connection between gods . deities often form male and female pairs , reflecting the importance of procreation in egyptian religious thought . families of three deities , with a father , mother , and child , represent the creation of new life and the succession of the father by the child , a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession . osiris , isis , and horus formed the quintessential family of this type . the pattern they set grew more widespread over time , so that many deities in local cult centers , like ptah , sekhmet , and their child nefertum at memphis and amun , mut , and khonsu at thebes , were assembled into family triads . genealogical connections like these are changeable , in keeping with the multiple perspectives in egyptian belief . hathor , as a fertility goddess , could act as mother to any child god , including the child form of the sun god , although in other circumstances she was the sun god \\'s daughter . \\n  other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles , or who together represented a region of the egyptian mythological cosmos . there were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each nome ( province ) of egypt . some of these groups contain a specific , symbolically important number of deities . paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity . ra , who is dynamic and light @-@ producing , and osiris , who is static and shrouded in darkness , merge into a single god each night . groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient egyptian thought , and groups of four connote completeness . rulers in the late new kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others : amun , ra , and ptah . these deities stood for the plurality of all gods , as well as for their own cult centers ( the major cities of thebes , heliopolis , and memphis ) and for many threefold sets of concepts in egyptian religious thought . sometimes set , the patron god of the nineteenth dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world , was added to this group , which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon . \\n  nine , the product of three and three , represents a multitude , so the egyptians called several large groups \" enneads \" , or sets of nine , even if they had more than nine members . the most prominent ennead was the ennead of heliopolis , an extended family of deities descended from the creator god atum , which incorporates many important gods . the term \" ennead \" was often extended to include all of egypt \\'s deities . \\n  this divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy . gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society . at the apex of this society was the king of the gods , who was usually identified with the creator deity . in different periods of egyptian history , different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position . horus was the most important god in the early dynastic period , ra rose to preeminence in the old kingdom , amun was supreme in the new , and in the ptolemaic and roman periods , isis was the divine queen and creator goddess . newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors . isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise , and when amun became the ruler of the pantheon , he was conjoined with ra , the traditional king of the gods , to become a solar deity . \\n  = = = manifestations and combinations = = = \\n  the gods were believed to manifest in many forms . the egyptians had complex conception of the human soul , consisting of several parts . the spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements . the ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it . any visible manifestation of a god \\'s power could be called its ba ; thus , the sun was called the ba of ra . a depiction of a deity was considered a ka , another component of its being , which acted as a vessel for that deity \\'s ba to inhabit . the cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals , as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities , were believed to house divine bas in this way . gods could be ascribed many bas and kas , which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god \\'s nature . everything in existence was said to be one of the kas of atum the creator god , who originally contained all things within himself , and one deity could be called the ba of another , meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other \\'s power . divine body parts could act as separate deities , like the eye of ra and hand of atum , both of which were personified as goddesses . \\n  nationally important deities gave rise to local manifestations , which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods . horus had many forms tied to particular places , including horus of nekhen , horus of buhen , and horus of edfu . such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings . during the new kingdom , one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from amun of pe @-@ khenty . he consulted two other local oracles of amun hoping for a different judgment . gods \\' manifestations also differed according to their roles . horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child , and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities . \\n  gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided . a god could be called the ba of another , or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography . local gods were linked with greater ones , and deities with similar functions were combined . ra was connected with the local deity sobek to form sobek @-@ ra ; with his fellow ruling god , amun , to form amun @-@ ra ; with the solar form of horus to form ra @-@ horakhty ; and with several solar deities as horemakhet @-@ khepri @-@ ra @-@ atum . on rare occasion , even deities of different sexes were joined in this way , producing combinations like osiris @-@ neith and mut @-@ min . this linking of deities is called syncretism . unlike other situations for which this term is used , the egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems , although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones . instead , syncretism acknowledged the overlap between their roles , and extended the sphere of influence for each of them . syncretic combinations were not permanent ; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities . but closely connected deities did sometimes merge . horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions , such as khenty @-@ irty and khenty @-@ khety , who became little more than local manifestations of him ; hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess , bat ; and an early funerary god , khenti @-@ amentiu , was supplanted by osiris and anubis . \\n  = = = the aten and possible monotheism = = = \\n  in the reign of akhenaten ( c . 1353 – 1336 bc ) in the mid @-@ new kingdom , a single solar deity , the aten , became the sole focus of the state religion . akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased the gods \\' names and images on monuments , targeting amun in particular . this new religious system , sometimes called atenism , differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods . whereas , in earlier times , newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs , atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives . yet atenism may not have been full monotheism , which totally excludes belief in other deities . there is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private . the picture is further complicated by atenism \\'s apparent tolerance for some other deities , like shu . for these reasons , the egyptologist dominic montserrat suggested that akhenaten may have been monolatrous , worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others . in any case , atenism \\'s aberrant theology did not take root among the egyptian populace , and akhenaten \\'s successors returned to traditional beliefs . \\n  = = = unity of the divine in traditional religion = = = \\n  scholars have long debated whether traditional egyptian religion ever asserted that the multiple gods were , on a deeper level , unified . reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism , which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one , and the tendency of egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities . another point of contention is the appearance of the word \" god \" in wisdom literature , where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities . in the early 20th century , for instance , e. a. wallis budge believed that egyptian commoners were polytheistic , but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite , who wrote the wisdom literature . his contemporary james henry breasted thought egyptian religion was instead pantheistic , with the power of the sun god present in all other gods , while hermann junker argued that egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history . \\n  in 1971 , erik hornung published a study rebutting these views . he points out that in any given period many deities , even minor ones , were described as superior to all others . he also argues that the unspecified \" god \" in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere . although the combinations , manifestations , and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting , they were always restricted to a finite number of forms , never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way . henotheism , hornung says , describes egyptian religion better than other labels . an egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment , without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on . hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth , at the time before creation , after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence . \\n  hornung \\'s arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of egyptian religion , but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows . jan assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the new kingdom , beginning with a focus on amun @-@ ra as the all @-@ important sun god . in his view , atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend . it equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods . then , in the backlash against atenism , priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way , one that coexisted with traditional polytheism . the one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities , while at the same time , the multiple gods were aspects of the one . according to assmann , this one god was especially equated with amun , the dominant god in the late new kingdom , whereas for the rest of egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods . james p. allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the \" multiplicity of approaches \" in egyptian thought , as well as with the henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers . he says that the egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by \" identifying their uniform notion of \\' god \\' with a particular god , depending on the particular situation . \" \\n  = = descriptions and depictions = = \\n  egyptian writings describe the gods \\' bodies in detail . they are made of precious materials ; their flesh is gold , their bones are silver , and their hair is lapis lazuli . they give off a scent that the egyptians likened to the incense used in rituals . some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities , including their height and eye color . yet these characteristics are not fixed ; in myths , gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes . egyptian texts often refer to deities \\' true , underlying forms as \" mysterious \" . the egyptians \\' visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal . they symbolize specific aspects of each deity \\'s character , functioning much like the ideograms in hieroglyphic writing . for this reason , the funerary god anubis is commonly shown in egyptian art as a dog or jackal , a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies , in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection . his black coloring alludes to the color of mummified flesh and to the fertile black soil that egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection . \\n  most gods were depicted in several ways . hathor could be a cow , cobra , lioness , or a woman with bovine horns or ears . by depicting a given god in different ways , the egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature . the gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms , so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies . these forms include men and women ( anthropomorphism ) , animals ( zoomorphism ) , and , more rarely , inanimate objects . combinations of forms , such as gods with human bodies and animal heads , are common . new forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history . some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing , as with isis and hathor . because of the close connection between these goddesses , they could both wear the cow @-@ horn headdress that was originally hathor \\'s alone . \\n  certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god \\'s identity . the head of a given divine image is particularly significant . in a hybrid image , the head represents the original form of the being depicted , so that , as the egyptologist henry fischer put it , \" a lion @-@ headed goddess is a lion @-@ goddess in human form , while a royal sphinx , conversely , is a man who has assumed the form of a lion . \" divine headdresses , which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods \\' heads , are another important indicator . in contrast , the objects held in gods \\' hands tend to be generic . male deities hold was staffs , goddesses hold stalks of papyrus , and both sexes carry ankh signs , representing the egyptian word for \" life \" , to symbolize their life @-@ giving power . \\n  the forms in which the gods are shown , although diverse , are limited in many ways . many creatures that are widespread in egypt were never used in divine iconography , whereas a few , such as falcons , cobras , and cattle , can each represent many deities . animals that were absent from egypt in the early stages of its history were not used as divine images . for instance , the horse , which was only introduced in the second intermediate period ( c . 1650 – 1550 bc ) , never represented a god . similarly , the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in all periods changed little from the styles used in the old kingdom : a kilt , false beard , and often a shirt for male gods and a long , tight @-@ fitting dress for goddesses . \\n  the basic anthropomorphic form varies . child gods are depicted nude , as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized . certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts , signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance . whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow — the same colors used to depict egyptian men and women — some are given unusual , symbolic skin colors . thus the blue skin and paunchy figure of the god hapi alludes to the nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought . a few deities , such as osiris , ptah , and min , have a \" mummiform \" appearance , with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth . although these gods resemble mummies , the earliest examples predate the cloth @-@ wrapped style of mummification , and this form may instead hark back to the earliest , limbless depictions of deities . \\n  = = interactions with humans = = \\n  = = = relationship with the pharaoh = = = \\n  in official writings , pharaohs are said to be divine , and they are constantly depicted in the company of the deities of the pantheon . each pharaoh and his predecessors were considered the successors of the gods who had ruled egypt in mythic prehistory . living kings were equated with horus and called the \" son \" of many deities , particularly osiris and ra ; deceased kings were equated with these elder gods . pharaohs had their own mortuary temples where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths . but few pharaohs were worshipped as gods long after their lifetimes , and non @-@ official texts portray kings in a human light . for these reasons , scholars disagree about how genuinely most egyptians believed the king to be a god . he may only have been considered divine when he was performing ceremonies . \\n  however much it was believed , the king \\'s divine status was the rationale for his role as egypt \\'s representative to the gods , as he formed a link between the divine and human realms . the egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in , as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them . these things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw , with their priests and laborers . yet , according to royal ideology , temple @-@ building was exclusively the pharaoh \\'s work , as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead . these acts were a part of the king \\'s fundamental role : maintaining maat . the king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions , which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live . \\n  = = = presence in the human world = = = \\n  although the egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them , contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances . in literature , gods may appear to humans in a physical form , but in real life the egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication . \\n  the ba of a god was said to periodically leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god . by inhabiting these images , the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form . to the egyptians , a place or object that was ḏsr — \" sacred \" — was isolated and ritually pure , and thus fit for a god to inhabit . temple statues and reliefs , as well as particular sacred animals , like the apis bull , served as divine intermediaries in this way . dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction . in these states , it was believed , people could come close to the gods and sometimes receive messages from them . finally , according to egyptian afterlife beliefs , human souls pass into the divine realm after death . the egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature . \\n  temples , where the state rituals were carried out , were filled with images of the gods . the most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary . these statues were usually less than life @-@ size , and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods \\' bodies . many temples had several sanctuaries , each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad . the city \\'s primary god was envisioned as its lord , employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented . the gods residing in the temples of egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon . but many deities — including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile — were never given temples of their own , although some were represented in the temples of other gods . \\n  to insulate the sacred power in the sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world , the egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them . people other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues . the only exception was during festival processions , when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine . people did have less direct means of interaction . the more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer , from doorways to freestanding chapels near the back of the temple building . communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use , and some families had shrines inside their homes . despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine , the egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods . \\n  = = = intervention in human lives = = = \\n  egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the overarching order of nature . this divine influence applied mainly to egypt , as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order . but in the new kingdom , when other nations were under egyptian control , foreigners were said to be under the sun god \\'s benign rule in the same way that egyptians were . \\n  thoth , as the overseer of time , was said to allot fixed lifespans to both humans and gods . other gods were also said to govern the length of human lives , including meskhenet , who presided over birth , and shai , the personification of fate . thus the time and manner of death was the main meaning of the egyptian concept of fate , although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well . several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions , working through a person \\'s \" heart \" — the seat of emotion and intellect in egyptian belief . deities were also believed to give commands , instructing the king in the governance of his realm and regulating the management of their temples . egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons , and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes . morality in ancient egypt was based on the concept of maat , which , when applied to human society , meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with the well @-@ being of other people . because deities were the upholders of maat , morality was connected with them . for example , the gods judged humans \\' moral righteousness after death , and by the new kingdom , a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into the afterlife . but in general , morality was based on practical ways to uphold maat in daily life , rather than on strict rules that the gods laid out . \\n  humans had free will to ignore divine guidance and the behavior required by maat , but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves . a deity carried out this punishment using its ba , the force that manifested the god \\'s power in the human world . natural disasters and human ailments were seen as the work of angry divine bas . conversely , the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans . both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities : shed , who emerged in the new kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm , and petbe , an apotropaic god from the late eras of egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing . \\n  egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly . misfortune was often seen as a product of isfet , the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat , and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events . some deities who were closely connected with isfet , such as set , could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods . but some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery , while others give theodicies in the gods \\' defense . beginning in the middle kingdom , several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth . because of this human misbehavior , the creator is distant from his creation , allowing suffering to exist . new kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the middle kingdom . they emphasize humans \\' direct , personal relationships with deities and the gods \\' power to intervene in human events . people in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives . as a result , upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods \\' favor as a way to guarantee a good life . even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid , and after the new kingdom came to an end , government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods \\' will . \\n  = = = worship = = = \\n  official religious practices , which maintained maat for the benefit of all egypt , were related to , but distinct from , the religious practices of ordinary people , who sought the gods \\' help for their personal problems . \\n  official religion involved a variety of rituals , based in temples . some rites were performed every day , whereas others were festivals , taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity . the gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies , in which their statues were clothed , anointed , and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor . these offerings , in addition to maintaining maat for the gods , celebrated deities \\' life @-@ giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful . \\n  festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque @-@ shaped shrine . these processions served various purposes . in roman times , when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the nile inundation , processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood . processions also traveled between temples , as when the image of hathor from dendera temple visited her consort horus at the temple of edfu . rituals for a god were often based in that deity \\'s mythology . such rituals were meant to be repetitions of the events of the mythic past , renewing the beneficial effects of the original events . in the khoiak festival in honor of osiris , his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout . the returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god \\'s own life . \\n  personal interaction with the gods took many forms . people who wanted information or advice consulted oracles , run by temples , that were supposed to convey gods \\' answers to questions . amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well @-@ being or to impart the god \\'s positive characteristics to the wearer . private rituals invoked the gods \\' power to accomplish personal goals , from healing sickness to cursing enemies . these practices used heka , the same force of magic that the gods used , which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune . the performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth , or even threatened a deity , to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal . such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers , and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help . \\n  prayer and private offerings are generally called \" personal piety \" : acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god . evidence of personal piety is scant before the new kingdom . votive offerings and personal names , many of which are theophoric , suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods . but firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the new kingdom , reaching a peak late in that era . scholars disagree about the meaning of this change — whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions . egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples . they recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae . they gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to , or that symbolized the result they desired ; thus a relief image of hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility . occasionally , a person took a particular god as a patron , dedicating his or her property or labor to the god \\'s cult . these practices continued into the latest periods of egyptian history . these later eras saw more religious innovations , including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form , such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess bastet . some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship , but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition . \\n  the worship of some egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands , especially to canaan and nubia during the new kingdom , when those regions were under pharaonic control . in canaan , the exported deities , including hathor , amun , and set , were often syncretized with native gods , who in turn spread to egypt . the egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in canaan , and their importance there waned after egypt lost control of the region . in contrast , many temples to the major egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in nubia . after the end of egyptian rule there , the imported gods , particularly amun and isis , were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of nubia \\'s independent kingdom of kush . these gods were incorporated into the nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in egypt , so that amun was considered the divine father of the king and isis and other goddesses were linked with the nubian queen , the kandake . some deities reached farther . taweret became a goddess in minoan crete , and amun \\'s oracle at siwa oasis was known to and consulted by people across the mediterranean region . \\n  under the greek ptolemaic dynasty and then roman rule , greeks and romans introduced their own deities to egypt . these newcomers equated the egyptian gods with their own , as part of the greco @-@ roman tradition of interpretatio graeca . but the worship of the native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones . instead , greek and roman gods were adopted as manifestations of egyptian ones . egyptian cults sometimes incorporated greek language , philosophy , iconography , and even temple architecture . meanwhile , the cults of several egyptian deities — particularly isis , osiris , anubis , the form of horus named harpocrates , and the fused greco @-@ egyptian god serapis — were adopted into roman religion and spread across the roman empire . roman emperors , like ptolemaic kings before them , invoked isis and serapis to endorse their authority , inside and outside egypt . in the empire \\'s complex mix of religious traditions , thoth was transmuted into the legendary esoteric teacher hermes trismegistus , and isis , who was venerated from britain to mesopotamia , became the focus of a greek @-@ style mystery cult . isis and hermes trismegistus were both prominent in the western esoteric tradition that grew from the roman religious world . \\n  temples and cults in egypt itself declined as the roman economy deteriorated in the third century ad , and beginning in the fourth century , christians suppressed the veneration of egyptian deities . the last formal cults , at philae , died out in the fifth or sixth century . most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years , remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries . but many of the practices involved in their worship , such as processions and oracles , were adapted to fit christian ideology and persisted as part of the coptic church . given the great changes and diverse influences in egyptian culture since that time , scholars disagree about whether any modern coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion . but many festivals and other traditions of modern egyptians , both christian and muslim , resemble the worship of their ancestors \\' gods . \\n  = south of heaven = \\n  south of heaven is the fourth studio album by american thrash metal band slayer . released on july 5 , 1988 , the album was the band \\'s second collaboration with record producer rick rubin , whose production skills on slayer \\'s previous album reign in

became an american recordings album after rick rubin ended his partnership with russell simmons . it was one of only two def jam titles to be distributed by geffen records through warner bros. records because of original distributor columbia records \\' refusal to release work by the band . the release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a gold certification by the recording industry association of america . \\n  in order to offset the pace of the group \\'s previous album , slayer deliberately slowed down the album \\'s tempo . in contrast to their previous albums , the band utilized undistorted guitars and toned @-@ down vocals . while some critics praised this musical change , others — more accustomed to the style of earlier releases — were disappointed . the songs \"

whatever they recorded would be \" compared to that album \" , he believed they \" had to slow down \" , something slayer had never done on albums before , or since . guitarist kerry king cited the need to \" keep people guessing \" as another reason for the musical shift . \" in order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on reign in blood , slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole \" , according to slayer \\'s official biography . \" they also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned @-@ down vocal styles not heard on previous albums . \" \\n  king

himself as \" probably the odd man out at that point \" , he admitted he \" didn ’ t participate as much because of that . \" hanneman said : \" we go through dry spells sometimes , but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without . i guess at that time , kerry was hitting a dry spell . \" king has also been critical of the album in general , describing it as one of his least favorite slayer albums . he feels vocalist tom araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style , and \" added too much singing . \" drummer dave lombardo has since observed : \" there was fire on all the records , but it started dimming when south of heaven came into the picture . and that \\'s me personally . again , i was probably wanting something else . \" \\n  judas priest \\'s \" dissident aggressor \" is the only cover version to appear on a slayer studio album . the song was chosen due to its war @-@ themed lyrics . hanneman described the track as \" more just like one of those odd songs that a lot of people didn \\'t know , but it was a favorite of kerry and i , so we just picked that one . \" meanwhile , \" cleanse the

the united kingdom on january 1 , 1993 , slayer \\'s first record to do so in that country . slayer \\'s official biography states that \" some critics praised the album as demonstrating slayer \\'s desire to grow musically and avoid repeating themselves . \" alex henderson of allmusic described the record as \" disturbing and powerful , \" while joe matera of ultimate guitar deemed the album a slight departure ; he wrote that while the pace was slowed down , it \" didn \\'t sacrifice any of the heaviness inherent in slayer \\'s music . \" \\n  reviewing the 2003 slayer box set soundtrack to the apocalypse , adrien begrand of popmatters described the album as \" their most underrated , and on this set , its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record . \" knac.com \\'s

frontman matt drake stated that while reign in blood \" was just speed \" , south of heaven proved that the group could write \" slow material as well . \" metal forces reviewer gives \" the band credit for at least making an effort to try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career \" , creating \" one of the more original sounding thrash / speed

noting \" the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place : dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser , the sinewy opening notes kicked in , followed by an overture of bass , cymbal crashes , and tom fills , leading up to the slowly building crescendo \" in a concert review . lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of \" south of heaven \" and thinking

transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation . although the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition , some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation ( ga ) in the uk . the sector operates business jets , rotorcraft , piston and jet @-@ engined fixed @-@ wing aircraft , gliders of all descriptions , and lighter than air craft . public transport operations include business ( or corporate ) aviation and air taxi services , and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector . other commercial ga activities are aerial work , such as surveying and air ambulances , and flight training , which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport ( cat ) industry . private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation . it includes a strong vintage aircraft movement , and encompasses a range of air sports , such as racing , aerobatics , and parachuting , at which british teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition . \\n  of the 21 @,@ 000 civil aircraft registered in the uk , 96 per cent are engaged in ga operations , and annually the ga fleet accounts for between 1 @.@ 25 and 1 @.@ 35 million hours flown . the single most common class of aircraft is the fixed @-@ wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga , but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft , such as microlights , amateur built aeroplanes , and smaller helicopters . there are 28 @,@ 000 private pilot licence holders , and 10 @,@ 000 certified glider pilots . some of the 19 @,@ 000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in ga activities . although ga operates from more than 1 @,@ 800 aerodromes and landing sites , ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips , over 80 per cent of ga activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes . the ga industry , which is around 7 per cent the size of its cat cousin , employs 12 @,@ 000 people , and contributes £ 1 @.@ 4 billion to the uk economy . \\n  ga is regulated by the civil aviation authority ( caa ) , although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) . the main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing , and the objective is to promote high standards of safety . at the lighter end of the ga spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies , and gliding is in transition from a self @-@ regulatory model to more formal governance by easa . airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of cat operations has reduced the area in which ga flights can be freely conducted . the growth in cat is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the ga sector , and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re @-@ development for more profitable uses . the uk planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of ga public transport operations , and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the ga market . the planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome @-@ related environmental issues which , particularly regarding noise , are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at ga . \\n  = = definitions = = \\n  the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) defines general aviation ( ga ) as \" an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation . \" it defines commercial air transport ( cat ) as \" an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers , cargo or mail for remuneration or hire \" , and aerial work as \" an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture , construction , photography , surveying , observation and patrol , search and rescue , aerial advertisement , etc . \" \\n  organisations in the united kingdom ( uk ) describe ga in less restrictive terms that include elements of commercial aviation . the british business and general aviation association interprets it to be \" all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the armed services \" . the general aviation awareness council applies the description \" all civil aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non @-@ scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire \" . for the purposes of a strategic review of ga in the uk , the civil aviation authority ( caa ) defined the scope of ga as \" a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule \" , and considered it necessary to depart from the icao definition and include aerial work and minor cat operations . \\n  = = history = = \\n  the first aerodrome in the uk was established by the aero club at muswell manor on the isle of sheppey , and in may 1909 it was the venue of the first flight conducted in the country by a british pilot , john moore @-@ brabazon . in 1910 the aero club was granted the royal prefix , took responsibility for controlling all private flying in the uk , and started issuing the first british pilot licences . the introduction of the de havilland dh.60 moth in 1925 revolutionised light aviation , and the royal aero club , recognising the \" vital necessity of promoting civil flying \" , formed the light aeroplane club scheme . between 1925 and 1939 around 60 flying clubs were started , and more than 5 @,@ 000 pilots were trained . \\n  during world war ii civil aerodromes were taken over for military use , existing military airfields were expanded , and new ones were built . this resulted in a significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war . pre @-@ war civil aerodromes , for example sywell , were returned to civilian use . surplus military airfields were closed , and in some cases , for example beccles , subsequently re @-@ opened as civil aerodromes . the ministry of civil aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the uk , and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until the establishment of the independent caa in 1972 . \\n  with an expanded infrastructure in place , ga became established after the war when manufacturers such as cessna and piper introduced light aircraft designed for the private market . the cessna 172 , developed from the late 1940s cessna 170 , was introduced in 1956 , and became the world \\'s best selling single @-@ engine aeroplane . single piston @-@ engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the uk ga fleet . the development of the rogallo wing in the 1950s fostered the development of hang @-@ gliding during the 1960s and 1970s . the 1960s also saw experiments with motorised hang gliders , but it was not until the 1970s that this blend of technologies started to mature , resulting in the birth of the microlight movement . another milestone in the development of ga was the 1964 introduction of the learjet 23 . although it was not the first business jet , it popularised corporate aviation , and established the personal jet as a \" whole new class of aircraft \" . \\n  = = activities = = \\n  the ga sector operates a range of aircraft , including balloons and airships , gliders , hang gliders , paragliders , microlights , gyrocopters , helicopters , amateur built and mass @-@ produced light aircraft , ex @-@ military aircraft , and business jets . flights can be broadly categorised as public transport , aerial work , and private flying , the first two of which are commercial activities . \\n  = = = commercial operations = = = \\n  commercial operations are remunerated activities which fall within the icao definition of cat . some are , however , closely aligned to , and considered part of , the ga sector . public transport operations are non @-@ scheduled , on @-@ demand services flying between points specified by the customer , providing a more flexible service than airline travel . air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties , and business or corporate aviation uses company @-@ owned aircraft to transport employees and clients . aircraft used in these operations include business jets , helicopters , and twin piston @-@ engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people . an example of this type of operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the british formula one grand prix at silverstone . this involves so many flights that , according to cranfield aviation services , on race day the heliport is temporarily the world \\'s busiest airport . aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial ga sector , characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non @-@ transport activities , such as surveying , crop spraying , and emergency services work ( air ambulance and police ) . \\n  = = = flying schools = = = \\n  flying schools are commercial businesses engaged in the training of pilots , both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally . they make widespread use of fixed @-@ wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga , not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights . school @-@ owned aircraft account for a significant amount of ga activity , both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements . the pilot training element is regarded by the ga community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry . it is claimed by the general aviation awareness council that 60 – 70 per cent of professional pilots have self @-@ financed their flight training at ga schools , and one uk airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70 – 80 per cent of new pilots coming from the ga sector . the caa estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent . the counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the uk , and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy ga sector in the uk for its supply of pilots . the caa concludes that a severe reduction in ga would give \" some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened \" , but that the data on flying hours \" does not support such a gloomy outlook . \" of course , reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the uk foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity . \\n  = = = private flying = = = \\n  private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport , using aircraft that are owned individually , collectively as part of a syndicate , or rented from a flying club . a survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome , visits to other aerodromes , and day trips away . half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from , and only 9 per cent involved an overnight stay away from home . \\n  private flying is most associated with the traditional form of factory @-@ produced two and four @-@ seater , single piston @-@ engine training and touring aircraft . examples of these are the cessna 152 , cessna 172 , and piper pa28 cherokee , all with their origins in the 1950s , and the more modern designs of cirrus . the average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £ 133 , compared to an estimated £ 77 per hour for gliders , and a reported £ 35 per hour for microlights . recent trends have seen an increase in the use of microlights , and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the robinson r22 and r44 . another growth area in private flying in recent years has been in the use of amateur built aircraft , such as the van \\'s aircraft rv @-@ 4 and the europa . \\n  there is a strong vintage aircraft movement in the uk , with two @-@ thirds of the 500 registered historic aircraft active . these cover the whole spectrum of civil and military aviation , examples being the de havilland dragon rapide airliner of the 1930s , and the world war ii ( wwii ) spitfire fighter . there are many post @-@ wwii aircraft which could also be considered historic under a looser definition , including for example 60 ex @-@ military jets such as the hawker hunter . historic aircraft are regular exhibits at air displays , which are claimed to be the second most popular spectator activity after football in the uk . \\n  = = = sports = = = \\n  competitive gliding in the uk takes place between may and september . regionals are local competitions , organised and run by one of the bigger gliding clubs in the region , and represent the entry level to glider racing . races are handicapped according to glider performance , and normally take place over nine days . success in the regionals allows pilots to progress to the nationals , where there are five classes of competition . these are based on glider performance , the lowest being club class , and then progressing through standard ( maximum 15 metres ( 49 ft ) wingspan , and flaps not permitted ) , 15 metres ( 49 ft ) ( as standard , but flaps are permitted ) , 18 metres ( 59 ft ) ( maximum 18 metres ( 59 ft ) wingspan ) , and finally open @-@ class ( no restrictions ) . success at national level can lead to a place in the national team and competition at international level . in 2007 the british gliding team was ranked number one , and british pilots took two women \\'s world championships and the open class european championship . \\n  handicapped air racing is open to any propeller @-@ driven aircraft capable of maintaining a minimum speed of 100 miles ( 160 km ) per hour in level flight . races are a case of \" fly low , fly fast , turn left \" , consisting of 4 – 5 laps round a 20 – 25 mile ( 32 – 40 km ) circuit . faster aircraft are handicapped by starting after slower aircraft , the intention being that the race concludes with all aircraft diving for the finish line together . there are up to 16 races per year , conducted at airfields in the uk , france and the channel islands , for prizes that include the schneider trophy and king \\'s cup , and the season culminates with the british air racing and european air racing championships . \\n  aerobatic competitions take place for both powered aircraft and gliders , with up to 30 events each year in the uk and ireland . starting at the beginner level , pilots can move up to standard ( powered aircraft ) or sports ( glider ) levels , and then on to intermediate , advanced , and finally unlimited classes . each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft . national championships are awarded annually at standard / sports , intermediate , advanced ( powered aircraft only ) , and unlimited levels , and pilots who have reached advanced and unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the uk in international competition . \\n  parachute competitions are held at club , regional , national and international levels , and include the disciplines of accuracy landings , freefall gymnastics , formation skydiving , canopy formation , freestyle and freeflying , and skysurfing . british teams consistently win medals in canopy formation world championships , and a british team took the 2006 world championship in women \\'s 4 @-@ way formation skydiving . \\n  = = aerodromes = = \\n  aerodrome is a collective term for any location from which flying operations take place , although more specific terminology can be used to characterise its purpose . the caa strategic review of ga applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations , and airfield to locations which predominantly support ga operations . the general aviation small aerodrome research study ( gasar ) analysed 687 aerodromes in england which come under the scope of ga , classifying 374 into six types . these range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip , although 84 per cent of ga flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories . \\n  = = = gasar aerodrome classification = = = \\n  the factors used in determining how an individual aerodrome is categorised by the gasar study are based broadly on size and facilities . the six types of aerodrome are described , in size order , as : regional airports ( e.g. east midlands ) ; major ga airports ( e.g. oxford ) ; developed ga airfields ( e.g. andrewsfield ) ; basic ga airfields ( e.g. rufforth ) ; developed airstrips ( e.g. tilstock ) ; and basic airstrips ( e.g. chilbolton in hampshire ) . the actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex , using 28 different parameters , backed up with a peer review by experienced ga pilots . \\n  airports generally have long , fully lit , hard @-@ surfaced runways , full air traffic control , and navigation and landing aids . they are usually located on urban fringes , support commercial and business operations , and often exclude certain types of light aircraft . at the more rurally located airfields , the lighter end of aviation , such as microlight and gliding activities , becomes increasingly prevalent , and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools . at this level runways are generally shorter , and grass surfaces are increasingly common . navigation aids are increasingly scarce , being more basic where they are available , and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control . the smallest airfields are too small to feature on general purpose ordnance survey ( os ) maps , and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance . the majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities , although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples . they do not feature on os maps , and are owned by private clubs or , more commonly , individuals . \\n  = = = aerodrome licensing = = = \\n  most aerodromes used for public transport operations are required to be licensed by the caa . to be granted a licence an aerodrome operator must satisfy the caa that : the physical conditions at the aerodrome , and its environs , are acceptable ; the scale of equipment , and facilities provided , are adequate for the flying activities which are expected to take place ; an effective safety management system is in place ; and that staff are competent and , where necessary , suitably qualified . aerodromes classified as developed ga airfields or larger by the gasar study are , with few exceptions , licensed . only two basic ga airfields , silverstone and duxford , are licensed , and all airstrips are unlicensed . the light aviation airports study group , a joint caa @-@ industry initiative , was established in 2005 to review the regulation of light aviation aerodromes . a particular focus of this group was a review of the restrictions placed on unlicensed aerodromes . the group concluded that the requirement for public transport operations to be conducted only from licensed aerodromes should be further reviewed in the context of corresponding international and european requirements . it also recommended that restrictions on flight training at unlicensed aerodromes should be lifted , and this was permitted from april 2010 \\n  = = scale of the sector = = \\n  there are an estimated 27 @,@ 000 civil aircraft registered in the uk , 96 per cent of which are engaged in ga activities . in 2005 the ga fleet comprised 9 @,@ 000 fixed @-@ wing aircraft , 4 @,@ 100 microlights , 1 @,@ 300 helicopters , 1 @,@ 800 airships / balloons , 2 @,@ 500 gliders and some 7 @,@ 000 hang gliders . estimates put the number of foreign @-@ registered ga aircraft based in the uk at 900 . \\n  the number of pilots licensed by the caa to fly powered aircraft in 2005 was 47 @,@ 000 , of whom 28 @,@ 000 held a private pilot licence . the remainder held professional pilot licences , either a commercial pilot licence or an airline transport pilot licence , although not all of these would be engaged in ga activities . in addition , there are 10 @,@ 000 active glider pilots , and estimates put the membership of aviation @-@ related sport and recreational associations at 36 @,@ 000 . \\n  the number of aerodromes that support ga in the uk is difficult to establish with certainty . pooleys 2008 united kingdom flight guide lists 355 , and the airplan flight equipment uk vfr flight guide 2008 lists nearly 500 . lockyears farm \\' strips \\' and private airfields flight guide lists more than 300 landing sites . the gasar study estimates 1 @,@ 100 formal flying sites in england alone , a figure which includes 400 sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight guides . it estimates another 759 informal sites known only to land owners , customs , and members of the enthusiast group air @-@ britain . \\n  the sector was estimated to employ nearly 12 @,@ 000 people and directly contribute £ 1 @.@ 4 billion to the uk economy in 2005 , making it roughly seven per cent of the size of the cat industry . nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation . \\n  = = trends = = \\n  most sectors of ga for which data are available have experienced growth in aircraft numbers and hours flown over the last two decades . the lighter end of the ga spectrum : microlights , amateur built , and airships and balloons , have in particular shown strong growth , although the last of these activities was severely curtailed during the foot @-@ and @-@ mouth outbreak in 2001 , when access to farmland was denied . after strong growth in the late 1980s , traditional flying has shown a slight decline recently , reflecting a move amongst recreational flyers towards microlight aircraft , and increased numbers of foreign @-@ registered aircraft . recreational helicopter usage has grown primarily due to the introduction of smaller and cheaper aircraft . glider activity has remained relatively static , although there has been a gradual increase in the number of self @-@ launching motor gliders . \\n  business aviation has shown strong growth , although the numbers of aircraft on the uk register have declined . this reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign @-@ registered business jets based in the uk , which are estimated to be growing in numbers . however , twin piston @-@ engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly , reflecting pressures on the light air @-@ taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services , and a more sophisticated corporate charter business . the amount of flight training conducted by uk schools has declined , largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools , which benefit from lower costs and better weather . \\n  since 1990 the total number of hours flown annually by the ga sector has remained in the range 1 @.@ 25 – 1 @.@ 35 million , the dominant sector being traditional ga flying , which accounts for 0 @.@ 6 million per year . an overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002 . the decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the ga industry is weakening , though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm . \\n  = = regulation = = \\n  the objective of regulation is to \" promote high standards of safety in all aspects of aviation \" , and this is the main area of interaction between the caa and the ga sector . efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness , pilot qualification , the rules for the movement of aircraft , and equipment to be carried . the caa was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the uk in 1972 . in 1991 it started working within the joint aviation authorities ( jaa ) framework to implement agreed common standards , known as the joint aviation requirements ( jar ) , throughout the european union ( eu ) . in 2003 this was taken a step further when the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) was established as the central eu regulator , taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities . the caa acts as an agency of easa on these issues , retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to easa . proposed developments seek to establish easa as the single authority throughout the eu , taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of easa . \\n  = = = devolved and self @-@ regulation = = = \\n  within this framework certain sectors of ga are governed on a devolved basis . in all cases the caa / easa retains responsibility for safety regulation , but representative bodies , particularly of sectors that are not included in the scope of easa , are granted greater oversight of their activities . the majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the british microlight aircraft association ( bmaa ) , although a significant number are regulated by the light aircraft association ( laa ) , formerly known as the popular flying association . the laa is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft , as well as vintage and classic aircraft . parachuting is governed by the british parachute association , although the aircraft used in this activity are generally caa @-@ regulated . balloon and airship flying is overseen by the british balloon and airship club . the uk @-@ specific national private pilot licence ( nppl ) is administered by the national pilots licensing group ltd . , supported by the laa , the aircraft owners and pilots association uk , the british gliding association , and the british microlight aircraft association . separate from these devolved groups , gliding in the uk is self @-@ regulated . the british gliding association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness , now formally regulated as a result of easa legislation , and still retains control of pilot certification . hang gliding and paragliding activities ( i.e. foot @-@ launched gliders ) are governed by the british hang gliding and paragliding association . \\n  = = = airworthiness = = = \\n  under caa and easa rules , all aircraft are required to meet certain standards of airworthiness to fly safely and legally . aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a certificate of airworthiness . however , british @-@ registered aircraft which are excluded from the scope of easa , and which cannot satisfy the requirements for the issue of a certificate of airworthiness , may be issued with a permit to fly . this allows them to fly in uk airspace subject to certain limitations , for example being restricted to day @-@ time flights under visual flight rules only . a number of organisations ( e.g. the british microlight aircraft association and the light aircraft association ) have obtained a standing over @-@ flight permission for permit to fly aircraft within their area of interest with some european countries , notably france . permits are typically issued to vintage and historic aircraft , amateur built aircraft , and microlights . \\n  = = = pilot licensing = = = \\n  the pilot qualification most relevant to ga is the private pilot licence ( ppl ) , which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration . in addition to the european @-@ wide joint aviation regulations flight crew licensing ( jar @-@ fcl ) standard , the caa also issues uk @-@ specific national licences . in the absence of european standards for gyroplane , balloon , and airship pilots , the caa licenses these according to the original uk ppl standard . as a response to the perception that jar pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots , the national private pilot licence ( nppl ) was introduced in 2002 . the nppl is easier to obtain than the jar @-@ fcl licence , has less stringent medical requirements , is more restrictive in the privileges it grants , and is valid only for flights in british @-@ registered aircraft flying in uk and french airspace . although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of easa , the gliding sector is currently self @-@ regulating in this respect . the british gliding association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training , and certifying , via a badge system , pilots who meet those standards . pilots working in sectors of ga that are commercial operations , such as aerial work and business aviation , are required to hold a professional pilot licence which , at a minimum , is the commercial pilot licence . \\n  = = safety = = \\n  between 1995 and 2004 there were 2 @,@ 630 accidents involving ga aircraft , of which 139 were fatal , resulting in the loss of 317 lives . the majority of accidents involved small fixed @-@ wing aircraft engaged in private flights , and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to : flight handling skills ; poor judgement or airmanship ; lack of training or experience ; and omission of , or inappropriate , action . \\n  there were 27 fatal accidents involving ga aircraft in 2007 , resulting in the loss of 48 lives . these compare with 16 accidents claiming a total of 19 lives the previous year , and although the 2007 statistics are higher than average , they are not exceptional . \\n  = = issues = = \\n  the growth in commercial air transport ( cat ) has eroded the operational freedom of ga , both in the air and on the ground at larger airports . difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a decline in the number of aerodromes generally , and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re @-@ development for more profitable uses . the uk planning system is designed to focus on local issues , and consideration of the national impact of ga operations is not within its remit . this makes aerodrome development difficult , often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use . \\n  = = = airspace access = = = \\n  airspace is shared by cat , military and ga users . it is divided into controlled airspace , in which aircraft must always be under the control of an air traffic controller , and uncontrolled airspace , in which aircraft can operate autonomously . although ga flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace , they operate mainly outside of it . \\n  controlled airspace is essential for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of cat . a caa review found that \" mixing [ commercial ] operations with other users is considered undesirable , even untenable \" by commercial operators . however this position has resulted in extensive class a controlled airspace with complex boundaries , including some running down to the ground , prohibiting vfr access to airspace , resulting in high numbers of ga flights operating close to the borders of controlled airspace who could not get formal receipt of an air traffic service . coupled with pilot navigation errors , hundreds of airspace infringements have been recorded every year . \\n  increases in the number of cat operations , and in the number of airports they operate from , has resulted in a corresponding increase in class a controlled airspace . between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally , and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above england and wales , leading to a perception within the ga community of being squeezed out . there are particular problems for ga around large airports , where class a controlled airspace extends to ground level . the concentration of commercial operations and high demand for ga in the south east of england have also resulted in extensive areas of class a controlled airspace there , which serve to channel uncontrolled ga operations through high @-@ collision @-@ risk hot spots . \\n  = = = aerodrome access = = = \\n  regional airports , such as edinburgh airport , have experienced strong growth in cat operations in recent years . these operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with ga , and although there is no evidence of deliberate discrimination , the effect has been to discourage or exclude it . ga aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges , including the imposition of handling fees in some cases . some airports restrict or deny ga parking , and others limit or refuse certain ga activity . as a result , light ga aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large , busy international airports such as heathrow , stansted , gatwick and manchester . \\n  in addition to this de facto loss of facilities , the number of aerodromes in the uk has been in decline over the last 50 years , as a result of increasing urbanisation and the closure of airfields built during wwii . alternative and more profitable uses for land can also lead to existing aerodromes being threatened with closure , for example north weald , or actually being closed , as happened to ipswich airport. and bristol filton airport . referring to the importance of a \" functioning national network of ga airfields \" , especially where ga performs an air transport role , the caa states that \" there could be cause for concern if a significant further loss of airfields were to continue , especially if crucial nodes on the transport network were to be lost . \" \\n  = = = planning system = = = \\n  the planning system is critical to the viability and operation of ga aerodromes . with many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them , and with ga access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive , a viable network of aerodromes supporting ga air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue . however , there is no unified national planning policy specific to ga aerodromes , and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact . because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation , the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process , and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to ga land use are made . ga is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to local planning authorities , and most planning decisions relating to ga either refuse permission , or grant it with restrictive conditions . little gransden is just one example of a ga airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted , thereby inhibiting further development . such restrictions , if poorly conceived , can make ga operations unviable or even unsafe . \\n  = = criticism = = \\n  public opinion towards aviation generally is worsening , based on increasing environmental concerns relating to emissions and noise , and private flying has been criticised by respondents to a government consultation on aircraft noise as a frivolous or selfish activity . in terms of environmental complaints and enquiries made to the caa that relate specifically to ga , noise is \" by far \" the most common subject . half of the 2 @,@ 000 noise complaints made annually to the caa concern ga operations , most of which relate to aerobatics , helicopters using private sites , air balloon incidents , parachute dropping , and alleged low flying . \\n  planning guidance on aircraft noise advises that \" in some circumstances the public perceive general aircraft noise levels as more disturbing than similar levels around major airports . \" this is a result of the tonal characteristics of light aircraft engines and the activities they are engaged in , including : repetitive circuit flying at low @-@ altitude near an aerodrome , during which aircraft are audible for long periods ; slow climbing aircraft engaged in parachute drop or glider tug activities concentrated around the drop zone or aerodrome , also audible for long periods ; erratic and repetitive engine noise from aircraft engaged in aerobatics ; and piston @-@ engines on full power in areas of low background noise , leading to the perception that such noise is more intrusive . in an attempt to alleviate these problems , the majority of aerodromes implement noise abatement procedures designed to route aircraft away from noise sensitive areas , and more than 50 are required by the government to provide consultative facilities in which local concerns can be raised with aerodrome operators . \\n  = sms zrínyi = \\n  sms zrínyi ( \" his majesty \\'s ship zrínyi \" ) was a radetzky @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship ( schlachtschiff ) of the austro @-@ hungarian navy ( k.u.k. kriegsmarine ) , named for the zrinski , a noble croatian family . zrínyi and her sisters , erzherzog franz ferdinand and radetzky , were the last pre @-@ dreadnoughts built by the austro @-@ hungarian navy . \\n  during world war i , zrínyi saw action in the adriatic sea . she served with the second division of the austro @-@ hungarian navy \\'s battleships and shelled senigallia as part of the bombardment of the key seaport of ancona , italy , during may 1915 . however , allied control of the strait of otranto meant that the austro @-@ hungarian navy was , for all intents and purposes , effectively bottled up in the adriatic . nonetheless , the presence of the zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of allied ships . \\n  with the war going against the austrians by the end of 1918 , zrínyi was prepared to be transferred to the new state of slovenes , croats and serbs . on 10 november 1918 — just one day before the end of the war , navy officers sailed the battleship out of pola ( pula ) and eventually surrendered to a squadron of american submarine chasers . following the handover to the united states navy , she was briefly designated uss zrínyi . in the treaty of saint @-@ germain @-@ en @-@ laye , the transfer was not recognized ; instead , zrínyi was given to italy and broken up for scrap . \\n  = = design and construction = = \\n  zrínyi was built at the stabilimento tecnico triestino dockyard in trieste , the same place where her sister ships were built earlier . she was laid down on 15 november 1908 and launched from the slipway on 12 april 1910 . the teak used on zrínyi \\'s deck was the only material austria @-@ hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship . the ship was completed by 15 july 1911 , and on 22 november 1911 she was commissioned into the fleet . she was the last ship of the class to be completed and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men . \\n  zrínyi was 138 @.@ 8 m ( 455 ft 4 in ) long , and had a beam of 24 @.@ 6 m ( 80 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 1 m ( 26 ft 9 in ) . she displaced 14 @,@ 508 long tons ( 14 @,@ 741 t ) normally , and up to 15 @,@ 845 long tons ( 16 @,@ 099 t ) with a full combat load . she was powered by two @-@ shaft four @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines rated at 19 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower . the ship had a top speed of 20 @.@ 5 knots ( 38 @.@ 0 km / h ; 23 @.@ 6 mph ) . zrínyi was the first warship in the austro @-@ hungarian navy to use fuel oil to supplement her 12 yarrow @-@ type coal @-@ fired boilers . she had a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . \\n  the ship \\'s primary armament consisted of four 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns in two twin gun turrets . this was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in four wing turrets . the tertiary battery consisted of twenty 10 cm l / 50 guns in casemated single mounts , four 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 85 in ) l / 44 and one 47 mm l / 33 quick @-@ firing guns . furthermore , the ship \\'s boats were equipped with two 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6

assigned to the austro @-@ hungarian fleet \\'s 1st battle squadron after her 1911 commissioning . in 1912 , zrínyi and her two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern mediterranean sea . on the second cruise into the aegean sea , conducted from november to december , zrínyi and her sister ships were accompanied by the cruiser sms admiral spaun and a pair of destroyers . after returning to pola , the entire fleet mobilized for possible hostilities , as tensions flared in the balkans . \\n  in 1913 , zrínyi participated in an international naval demonstration in the ionian sea to protest the balkan wars . ships from other navies included in the demonstration were the british pre @-@ dreadnought hms king edward vii , the italian pre @-@ dreadnought ammiraglio di saint bon , the french armored cruiser edgar quinet , and the german light cruiser sms breslau . the most important action of the combined flotilla , which was under the command of british admiral cecil burney , was to blockade the montenegrin coast . the goal of the blockade was to prevent serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at scutari , where montenegro had besieged a combined force of albanians and ottomans . pressured by the international blockade , serbia withdrew its army from scutari , which was subsequently occupied by a joint allied ground force . \\n  during that year , the first of four new dreadnoughts , sms viribus unitis , that made up the tegetthoff class — the only dreadnoughts built for the austro @-@ hungarian navy — came into active service . with the commissioning of these dreadnoughts , zrínyi and her sisters were moved from the 1st division to the 2nd division of the 1st battle squadron . \\n  = = = world war i = = = \\n  at that time of the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria on 28 june 1914 , the battleships in the austro @-@ hungarian navy consisted of the radetzky class , the tegetthoff class ( which still had one ship , sms szent istván , under construction ) , the erzherzog karl class and finally , the older habsburg class . along with the remainder of the austro @-@ hungarian navy , zrínyi was mobilized in late july 1914 to support the flight of sms goeben and sms breslau . the two german ships broke out of messina , which was surrounded by the british navy and reached turkey . the flotilla had advanced as far south as brindisi in southeastern italy when news of the successful breakout reached vienna . the austro @-@ hungarian ships were then recalled before seeing action . \\n  on 23 may 1915 , between two and four hours after news of the italian declaration of war reached the main austro @-@ hungarian naval base at pola , zrínyi and the rest of the fleet departed to bombard the italian and montenegrin coast . their focus was on the important naval base at ancona , and later the coast of montenegro . the bombardment of montenegro was part of the larger austro @-@ hungarian campaign against the kingdoms of montenegro and serbia , who were members of the entente , during the first half of 1915 . the attack on ancona was an immense success , and the ships were unopposed during the operation . the bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an italian steamer in the port of ancona itself , and an italian destroyer , turbine , was severely damaged further south . on the shore , the infrastructure of the port of ancona , as well as the surrounding towns , were severely damaged . the railroad yard in ancona , as well as the port facilities in the town , were damaged or destroyed . the local shore batteries were also suppressed . during the bombardment , zrínyi also helped to destroy a train , a railway station , and a bridge at senigallia . additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves , warehouses , oil tanks , radio stations , and the local barracks . sixty @-@ three italians , both civilians and military personnel , were killed in the bombardment . by the time italian ships from taranto and brindisi arrived on the scene , the austro @-@ hungarians were safely back in pola . \\n  the objective of the bombardment of ancona was to delay the italian army from deploying its forces along the border with austria @-@ hungary by destroying critical transportation systems . the surprise attack on ancona succeeded in delaying the italian deployment to the alps for two weeks . this delay gave austria @-@ hungary valuable time to strengthen its italian border and re @-@ deploy some of its troops from the eastern and balkan fronts . \\n  aside from the attack on ancona , the austro @-@ hungarian battleships were largely confined to pola for the duration of the war . their operations were limited by admiral anton haus , the commander of the austro @-@ hungarian navy , who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any italian attempt to seize the dalmatian coast . since coal was diverted to the newer tegetthoff @-@ class battleships , the remainder of the war saw zrínyi and the rest of the austro @-@ hungarian navy acting as a fleet in being . this resulted in the allied blockade of the otranto strait . with his fleet blockaded in the adriatic sea , and with a shortage of coal , haus followed a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the allied navies . \\n  = = = post @-@ war fate = = = \\n  after the austro @-@ hungarian empire collapsed in 1918 , the austrians wanted to turn the fleet over to the newly created state of slovenes , croats and serbs ( later to become a part of the kingdom of yugoslavia ) in order to prevent the italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war . however , the victorious allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the austrians and the south slavs and , in due course , reallocated the ships . the ship had been boarded by a scratch yugoslav crew on 10 november 1918 , one day before the armistice , and had left pola with her sister ship , radetzky . they were soon spotted by heavy italian ships , so the two battleships hoisted american flags and sailed south along the adriatic coast to castelli bay near spalato ( also known as split ) . they appealed for american naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender , which a squadron of united states navy ( usn ) submarine chasers in the area did . she had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south slav state , as it was a croat naval officer , korvettenkapitän marijan polić , who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the united states navy on the afternoon of 22 november 1919 at spalato ( split ) in dalmatia . simultaneously she was commissioned as uss zrínyi and lieutenant e.e. hazlett , usn , assumed command . the initial american complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men — the latter entirely composed of united states navy reserve force personnel . the ship remained at anchor at spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on . only once did she apparently turn her engines over , and that occurred during a severe gale that struck spalato on 9 february 1920 . \\n  on the morning of 7 november 1920 , zrínyi was decommissioned . uss chattanooga took her in tow and , assisted by brooks and hovey , towed the battleship to italy . under the terms of the treaties of versailles and st. germain , zrínyi was ultimately turned over to the italian government at venice . she was broken up for scrap later that year and into 1921 . \\n  = geopyxis carbonaria = \\n  geopyxis carbonaria is a species of fungus in the genus geopyxis , family

fruitbodies are commonly found on soil where brush has recently been burned , sometimes in great numbers . the fungus is distributed throughout many temperate regions of the northern hemisphere . it is found in europe , turkey , and north america . although it is primarily a saprotrophic species , feeding on the decomposing organic matter remaining after a fire , it also forms biotrophic associations with the roots of norway spruce . \\n  = = taxonomy = = \\n  the fungus was first described scientifically in 1805 by johannes baptista von albertini and lewis david de schweinitz as peziza carbonaria . mordecai cubitt cooke illustrated the fruitbodies , spores , and asci in his 1879 work mycographia , seu icones fungorum . figures of fungi from all parts of the world . in 1889 , pier andrea saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus geopyxis , giving the species its current name . pustularia carbonaria , published by heinrich rehm in 1884 , is a synonym of g. carbonaria . louis @-@ joseph grélet proposed the variety geopyxis carbonaria var. sessilis in 1937 , referring to forms producing fruitbodies without a stalk , but the taxon is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance . in 1860 miles berkeley and moses ashley curtis described the species peziza lepida from collections made in japan as part of the north pacific exploring and surveying expedition ( 1853 – 1856 ) . this taxon was synonymized with g. carbonaria by mien rifai in 1968 , a taxonomic opinion corroborated by donald pfister about a decade later . \\n  the specific epithet carbonaria derives from the latin word for \" charcoal \" . common names given to the fungus include \" charcoal loving elf @-@ cup \" , \" dwarf acorn cup \" , \" pixie cup \" , and the british mycological society approved \" stalked bonfire cup \" . \\n  = = description = = \\n  the fruitbodies ( ascocarps ) of geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped , 1 – 2 cm wide , and have fringed whitish margins . the inner spore @-@ bearing surface of the cup , the hymenium , is brick red and smooth , while the exterior surface is a dull yellow , and may be either smooth or have blister @-@ like spots ( pustules ) . the stipe is small ( 1 – 1 @.@ 5 mm long and 1 – 2 mm wide ) , whitish in color , and expands abruptly into the cup . the brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle . it does not have any distinctive taste , but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water . the edibility of the fungus is not known , but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating . \\n  = = = microscopic characteristics = = = \\n  in mass , the spores are whitish . the spores are elliptical , smooth , hyaline , devoid of oil droplets ( eguttulate ) , and have dimensions of 13 – 18 by 7 – 9 µm . they are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro in the absence of external stimuli . the asci are 190 – 225 by 9 – 10 µm . the paraphyses are slightly club @-@ shaped , unbranched , and have irregular orange @-@ brown granules , with tips up to 5 µm wide , and are not forked or lobed . the hypothecium , the layer of cells below the hymenium , is made of densely packed , small irregular cells . \\n  = = = similar species = = = \\n  the closely related vulcan elf cup ( geopyxis vulcanalis ) has a pale orange to yellowish fruitbody that is deeply cup shaped before flattening in maturity , and its crushed flesh often has an odor of sulfur . it may be distinguished microscopically by its paraphyses , which lack the orange @-@ brown granules characteristic of g. carbonaria . it also has larger spores , measuring 14 – 22 by 8 – 11 µm . unlike g. carbonaria , it grows on substrates other than burned wood , including mosses , and needle duff . tarzetta cupularis , which grows habitats similar to g. carbonaria , is distinguished microscopically by its spores that contain two oil droplets . other genera with similar species with which g. carbonaria may be confused in the field include aleuria , caloscypha , melastiza , and sowerbyella . \\n  = = habitat and distribution = = \\n  geopyxis carbonaria is widespread on burned soil or charcoal in the spring and throughout the growing season . it is one of the most common pioneer species found on burned ground . the charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil ph as well as the availability of minerals . fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees . most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn . the fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks . geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post @-@ fire stands as morels , although the former is usually more abundant . because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels , it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting . other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as g. carbonaria include those from the genera aleuria , anthracobia , peziza , and tarzetta . \\n  the fungus is found in europe ( from where it was originally described ) , and is widespread throughout north america . the north american distribution extends north to alaska . in 2010 , it was reported for the first time from turkey . \\n  = = ecology = = \\n  although primarily a saprotrophic fungus involved in the post @-@ fire breakdown of duff and coniferous roots , geopyxis carbonaria has been shown to be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with norway spruce ( picea abies ) . it had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus has a biotrophic interaction with lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta ) . the hyphae of g. carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling , but did not penetrate the endodermis . these traits suggest that the fungus is a moderate pathogen , with limited ability to cause reductions in seed germination . additionally , the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol oxidase , and can break down the complex organic polymer lignin — features characteristic of saprotrophic fungi . the formation of a rudimentary hartig net , a characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi , indicated that g. carbonaria might be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the right conditions . vrålstad and colleagues suggest that its below @-@ ground association with spruce roots protects it from physical damage in the event of a fire , and the extensive fruitbody production after a fire may reflect \" a successful fungal escape from a dying host where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic association \" . \\n  large fruitings of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree , such as that which occurs with burning . a field study conducted in norway demonstrated that fruit bodies were more likely to be found in areas that were heavily burned , compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable , or in clearcut areas . fruiting was much denser in spruce forests — with up to 700 – 1000 fruitbodies per square meter — than in pine forests , where fruitbodies were sporadic . fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the yellowstone fires of 1988 . \\n  = gold dollar = \\n  the gold dollar or gold one @-@ dollar piece was a coin struck as a regular issue by the united states bureau of the mint from 1849 to 1889 . the coin had three types over its lifetime , all designed by mint chief engraver james b. longacre . the type 1 issue had the smallest diameter of any united states coin ever minted . \\n  a gold dollar had been proposed several times in the 1830s and 1840s , but was not initially adopted . congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the california gold rush , and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar . in its early years , silver coins were being hoarded or exported , and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce . silver again circulated after congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter , and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the american civil war . \\n  gold did not again circulate in most of the nation until 1879 ; once it did , the gold dollar did not regain its place . in its final years , it was struck in small numbers , causing speculation by hoarders . it was also in demand to be mounted in jewelry . the regular issue gold dollar was last struck in 1889 ; the following year , congress ended the series . \\n  = = background = = \\n  in proposing his plan for a mint and a coinage system , secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton in 1791 proposed that the one @-@ dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin , and as one of silver , representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender . congress followed hamilton \\'s recommendation only in part , authorizing a silver dollar , but no coin of that denomination in gold . \\n  in 1831 , the first gold dollar was minted , at the private mint of christopher bechtler in north carolina . much of the gold then being produced in the united states came from the mountains of north carolina and georgia , and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by bechtler circulated through that region , and were now and then seen further away . additional one @-@ dollar pieces were struck by august bechtler , christopher \\'s son . \\n  soon after the bechtlers began to strike their private issues , secretary of the treasury levi woodbury became an advocate of having the mint of the united states ( \" mint \" , when described as an institution ) strike the one @-@ dollar denomination in gold . he was opposed by the mint director , robert m. patterson . woodbury persuaded president andrew jackson to have pattern coins struck . in response , patterson had mint second engraver christian gobrecht break off work on the new design for the silver one @-@ dollar coin and work on a pattern for the gold dollar . gobrecht \\'s design featured a liberty cap surrounded by rays on one side , and a palm branch arranged in a circle with the denomination , date , and name of the country on the other . \\n  consideration was given to including the gold dollar as an authorized denomination in the revisionary legislation that became the mint act of 1837 . the philadelphia newspaper public ledger , in december 1836 , supported a gold dollar , stating that \" the dollar is the smallest gold coin that would be convenient , and as it would be eminently so , neither silver nor paper should be allowed to take its place . \" nevertheless , after mint director patterson appeared before a congressional committee , the provision authorizing the gold dollar was deleted from the bill . \\n  = = inception = = \\n  in january 1844 , north carolina representative james iver mckay , the chairman of the committee on ways and means , solicited the views of director patterson on the gold dollar . patterson had more of gobrecht \\'s pattern dollar struck to show to committee members , again advising against a coin that if issued would be only about a half inch ( 13 mm ) in diameter . he told treasury secretary john c. spencer that the only gold coins of that size in commerce , the spanish and colombian half @-@ escudos , were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years . this seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time , and when a gold dollar was proposed again in 1846 , mckay \\'s committee recommended against it . \\n  even before 1848 , record amounts of gold were flowing to american mints to be struck into coin , but the california gold rush vastly increased these quantities . this renewed calls for a gold dollar , as well as for a higher denomination than the eagle ( $ 10 piece ) , then the largest gold coin . in january 1849 , mckay introduced a bill for a gold dollar , which was referred to his committee . there was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin ; one newspaper published a proposal for an annular gold dollar , that is , with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter . mckay amended his legislation to provide for a double eagle ( $ 20 gold coin ) and wrote to patterson , who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work , and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold plug in a silver coin . nevertheless , gobrecht \\'s successor as chief engraver , james b. longacre , prepared patterns , including some with a square hole in the middle . \\n  mckay got his fellow democrat , new hampshire senator charles atherton , to introduce the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the senate on february 1 , 1849 — atherton was chairman of the senate finance committee . mckay introduced a version into the house on february 20 ; debate began the same day . the dollar was attacked by congressmen from the whig party , then in the minority , on the grounds that it would be too small , would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime , the coins being similar in size . mckay did not respond substantively , but stated that if no one wanted these denominations , they would not be called for at the mint , and would not be coined . pennsylvania representative joseph ingersoll , a whig , spoke against the bill , noting that patterson opposed the new denominations , and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down , whenever considered . another whig , massachusetts \\'s charles hudson , related that patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference . mckay made no answer to these claims , but others did , including new york congressman henry nicoll , who assured the house that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated . the point was , he indicated , that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public , and , in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted . connecticut representative john a. rockwell , a whig , tried to table the bill , but his motion was defeated . the bill passed easily , and met only minimal opposition in the senate , becoming law on march 3 , 1849 . \\n  = = preparation = = \\n  the officers at the philadelphia mint , including chief coiner franklin peale , were mostly the friends and relations of director patterson . the outsider in their midst was chief engraver james b. longacre , successor to gobrecht ( who had died in 1844 ) . a former copper @-@ plate engraver , longacre had been appointed through the political influence of south carolina senator john c. calhoun . \\n  when longacre began work on the two new coins in early 1849 , he had no one to assist him . longacre wrote the following year that he had been warned by a mint employee that one of the officers ( undoubtedly peale ) planned to undermine the chief engraver \\'s position by having the work of preparing designs and dies done outside mint premises . accordingly , when the gold coin bill became law , longacre apprised patterson that he was ready to begin work on the gold dollar . the mint director agreed , and after viewing a model of the head on the obverse , authorized longacre to proceed with preparation of dies . according to longacre , \\n  the engraving was unusually minute and required very close and incessant labor for several weeks . i made the original dies and hubs for making the working dies twice over , to secure their perfect adaptation to the coining machinery . i had a wish to execute this work single handed , that i might thus silently reply to those who had questioned my ability for the work . the result , i believe , was satisfactory . \\n  = = original design = = \\n  the type 1 gold dollar depicts a head of liberty , facing left , with a coronet or tiara on her head bearing her name . her hair is gathered in a bun ; she is surrounded by 13 stars representing the original states . the reverse features the date and denomination within a wreath , with the name of the nation near the rim . \\n  contemporary reviews of the type 1 design were generally favorable . the new york weekly tribune on may 19 , 1849 described the new dollar as \" undoubtedly the neatest , tiniest , lightest , coin in this country ... it is too delicate and beautiful to pay out for potatoes , and sauerkraut , and salt pork . oberon might have paid puck with it for bringing the blossom which bewitched titania . \" willis \\' bank note list stated that \" there is no probability of them ever getting into general circulation ; they are altogether too small . \" the north carolina standard hoped that they would be struck at the charlotte mint and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small @-@ denomination bank notes from out of state . coin dealer and numismatic author q. david bowers notes that the head of liberty on the type 1 dollar is a scaled @-@ down version of that on the double eagle , and \" a nicely preserved gold dollar is beautiful to behold \" . \\n  = = modifications = = \\n  mint records indicate the first gold dollars were produced on may 7 , 1849 ; longacre \\'s diary notes state instead that the first were struck on may 8 . a few coins in proof condition were struck on the first day , along with about 1 @,@ 000 for circulation . there are five major varieties of the 1849 gold dollar from philadelphia , made as longacre continued to fine @-@ tune the design . mintmarked dies were sent by longacre \\'s engraving department at the philadelphia mint to the branch mints at charlotte , dahlonega ( in georgia ) , and new orleans ; coins struck at the branches resemble some of the types issued from philadelphia , depending on when the dies were produced . of the coins struck at the branch mints in 1849 , only pieces struck at charlotte ( 1849 @-@ c ) exist in multiple varieties ; most are of what is dubbed the \" closed wreath \" variety . approximately five of the 1849 @-@ c open wreath are known ; one , believed the finest surviving specimen , sold at auction for $ 690 @,@ 000 in 2004 , remaining a record for the gold dollar series as of 2013 . one of the changes made during production was the inclusion of longacre \\'s initial \" l \" on the truncation of liberty \\'s neck , the first time a u.s. coin intended for full @-@ scale production had borne the initial of its designer . all issues beginning in 1850 bear the closed wreath . beginning in 1854 , the gold dollar was also struck at the new san francisco mint . \\n  the continued flow of gold from california made silver expensive in terms of gold , and u.s. silver coins began to flow out of the country for melting in 1849 , a flow that accelerated over the next several years as the price of the metal continued to rise . by 1853 , a thousand dollars in silver coin contained $ 1 @,@ 042 worth of bullion . as silver coins vanished , the gold dollar became the only federal coin in circulation between the cent and the quarter eagle ( $ 2 @.@ 50 piece ) . as such , it was struck in large numbers and widely circulated . according to bowers in his book on the denomination , \" the years 1850 to 1853 were the high @-@ water mark of the gold dollar , the glory years of the denomination when the little gold coins took the place of half dollars and silver dollars in everyday transactions . \" this time came to an end in 1853 when congress passed an act reducing the weight of most silver coins , allowing new issues of them to circulate . \\n  as early as 1851 , new york congressman william duer alleged that that patterson had made the gold dollar too small in diameter on purpose to provoke criticism . patterson retired that year after 16 years in his position , and under his successor , george n. eckert , annular gold dollar and half dollar patterns were struck . public ledger reported that although gold dollars would not be struck in annular form , gold half dollars would be , to help fill the need for change . with the new pierce administration , thomas m. pettit took office as mint director on march 31 , 1853 . in april , treasury secretary james guthrie wrote to pettit that there were complaints that the gold dollar was too small , often lost or mistaken for a small silver coin , and enquiring about reports the mint had experimented with annular dollars . pettit replied , stating that none had been preserved , but enclosed a silver piece of equivalent size . he noted that while there would be technical difficulties in the production of the annular dollar , these could be overcome . in a letter dated may 10 , pettit proposed an oval @-@ shaped holed piece , or an angular @-@ shaped coin , which would lessen the production problems . pettit died suddenly on may 31 ; guthrie did not let the issue fall , but queried pettit \\'s replacement , james ross snowden , concerning the issue on june 7 . as u.s. coins were required to bear some device emblematic of liberty , the secretary hoped that artists could be found who could find some such design for an annular coin . \\n  the act of february 21 , 1853 , that had lightened the silver coins also authorized a gold three @-@ dollar piece , which began to be produced in 1854 . to ensure that the three @-@ dollar piece was not mistaken for other gold coins , it had been made thinner and wider than it would normally be , and longacre put a distinctive design with an indian princess on it . longacre adapted both the technique and the design for the gold dollar , which was made thinner , and thus wider . an adaptation of longacre \\'s princess for the larger gold coin was placed on the dollar , and a similar agricultural wreath on the reverse . the idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in congress as early as 1852 , and had been advocated by pettit , but guthrie \\'s desire for an annular coin stalled the matter . in may 1854 , snowden sent guthrie a letter stating that the difficulties with an annular coin , especially in getting the coins to eject properly from the press , were more than trivial . \\n  nevertheless , the type 2 gold dollar ( as it came to be known ) proved unsatisfactory as the mints had difficulty in striking the new coin so that all details were brought out . this was due to the high relief of the design — the three southern branch mints especially had trouble with the piece . many of the type 2 pieces quickly became illegible , and were sent back to philadelphia for melting and recoinage . on most surviving specimens , the \" 85 \" in the date is not fully detailed . the type 2 gold dollar was struck only at philadelphia in 1854 and 1855 , at the three southern branch mints in the latter year , and at san francisco in 1856 , after the design was designated for replacement . to correct the problems , longacre enlarged the head of liberty , making it a scaled @-@ down version of the three @-@ dollar piece , and moved the lettering on the obverse closer to the rim . this improved the metal flow and design sharpness so much that early numismatic scholars assumed the reverse was also altered , though in fact no change was made and the type 2 and type 3 reverses are identical . \\n  = = = design of type 2 and 3 dollars = = = \\n  the type 2 and 3 gold dollars depict liberty as a native american princess , with a fanciful feathered headdress not resembling any worn by any indian tribe . this image is an inexact copy of the design longacre had made for the three @-@ dollar piece , and is one of a number of versions of liberty longacre created based on the venus accroupie or crouching venus , a sculpture then on display in a philadelphia museum . for the reverse , longacre adapted the \" agricultural wreath \" he had created for the reverse of the three @-@ dollar piece , composed of cotton , corn , tobacco , and wheat , blending the produce of north and south . this wreath would appear , later in the 1850s , on the flying eagle cent . \\n  art historian cornelius vermeule deprecated the indian princess design used by longacre for the obverses of the types 2 and 3 gold dollar , and for the three @-@ dollar piece , \" the \\' princess \\' of the gold coins is a banknote engraver \\'s elegant version of folk art of the 1850s . the plumes or feathers are more like the crest of the prince of wales than anything that saw the western frontiers , save perhaps on a music hall beauty . \" \\n  = = war years = = \\n  the gold dollar continued to be produced in the late 1850s , though mintages declined from the figures of two million or more each year between 1850 and 1854 . only about 51 @,@ 000 gold dollars were produced in 1860 , with over two @-@ thirds of that figure at philadelphia , just under a third at san francisco , and 1 @,@ 566 at dahlonega . roughly a hundred are known of the last , creating one of the great rarities from dahlonega in the series . \\n  the other candidate for the rarest from that mint is the 1861 @-@ d , with an estimated mintage of 1 @,@ 000 and perhaps 45 to 60 known . two pairs of dies were shipped from philadelphia to dahlonega on december 10 , 1860 ; they arrived on january 7 , 1861 , two weeks before georgia voted to secede from the union , as the american civil war began . under orders from governor joseph e. brown , state militia secured the mint , and at some point , small quantities of dollars and half eagles were produced . records of how many coins were struck and when have not survived . since dies crack in time , and all the mints were supplied with them from philadelphia , coining could not last , and in may 1861 , coins and supplies remaining at dahlonega were turned over to the treasury of the confederate states of america , which georgia had by then joined . gold coins with a face value of $ 6 were put aside for assay . normally , they would have been sent to philadelphia to await the following year \\'s meeting of the united states assay commission , when they would be available for testing . instead , these were sent to the initial confederate capital of montgomery , alabama , though what was done with them there , and their ultimate fate , are unknown . the rarity of the 1861 @-@ d dollar , and the association with the confederacy , make it especially prized . \\n  dahlonega , like the other two branch mints in the south , closed its doors after the 1861 strikings . it and the charlotte facility never reopened ; the new orleans mint again struck coins from 1879 to 1909 , but did not strike gold dollars again . after 1861 , the only issuance of gold dollars outside philadelphia was at san francisco , in 1870 . \\n  the outbreak of the civil war shook public confidence in the union , and citizens began hoarding specie , gold and silver coins . in late december 1861 , banks and then the federal treasury stopped paying out gold at face value . by mid @-@ 1862 , all federal coins , even the base metal cent , had vanished from commerce in much of the country . the exception was the far west , where for the most part , only gold and silver were acceptable currencies , and paper money traded at a discount . in the rest of the nation , gold and silver coins could be purchased from banks , exchange agents , and from the treasury for a premium in the new greenbacks the government began to issue to fill the gap in commerce and finance the war . \\n  = = final years , abolition , and collecting = = \\n  since gold did not circulate in the united states ( except on the west coast ) in the postwar period , much of the production of coins of that metal in the united states was double eagles for export . accordingly , although 1 @,@ 361 @,@ 355 gold dollars were struck in 1862 — the last time production would exceed a million — the mintage fell to 6 @,@ 200 in 1863 and remained low for the rest of the coin \\'s existence , excepting 1873 and 1874 . the mint felt it improper to suspend coinage of a coin authorized by congress , and issued proof coins ( generally a few dozen to the tiny numismatic community ) from specially @-@ polished dies , also producing enough circulation strikes so that the proof coins would not be unduly rare . in 1873 and 1874 , old and worn gold dollars held by the government were melted and recoined , generating large mintages of that denomination . this was done in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments , which did not occur until the end of 1878 . once specie again circulated at face value , the gold dollar found no place in commerce amid large quantities of silver coinage , either released from hoarding or newly struck by the mint . the government expected that the resumption of specie payments would cause the dollar and other small gold coins to circulate again , but the public , allowed to redeem paper currency , continued to use it as more convenient than coins . \\n  in the 1870s and 1880s , public interest grew in the low @-@ mintage gold dollar . collecting coins was becoming more popular , and a number of numismatists put aside some gold dollars and hoped for increases in value . the mint most likely channeled its production through some favored philadelphia dealers , though proof coins could be purchased for $ 1 @.@ 25 at the cashier \\'s window at the philadelphia facility . banks charged a premium for circulation strikes . they were popular in the jewelry trade , mounted into various items . the coins were often exported to china or japan , where such jewelry was made . the dollars were often damaged in the process ; the mint refused to sell into this trade and did its best to hinder it . nevertheless , mint officials concluded that jewelers were successful at getting the majority of each issue . proof mintages exceeded 1 @,@ 000 by 1884 , and remained above that mark for the remainder of the series , numbers likely inflated by agents of jewelers , willing to pay the mint \\'s premium of $ .25 per coin . another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift ; after its abolition the quarter eagle became a popular present . \\n  james pollock , in his final report as mint director in 1873 , advocated limiting striking of gold dollars to depositors who specifically requested it . \" the gold dollar is not a convenient coin , on account of its small size , and it suffers more proportionately from abrasion than larger coins . \" his successors called for its abolition , with james p. kimball , before he left office in 1889 , writing to congress that except as jewelry , \" little practical use has been found for this coin \" . later that year , the new director , edward o. leech , issued a report stating that the gold dollar \" is too small for circulation , and ...

the other two types have dates valued at $ 300 in that grade . \\n  = = commemorative gold dollars = = \\n  the gold dollar had a brief resurrection during the period of early united states commemorative coins . between 1903 and 1922 nine different issues were produced , with a total mintage of 99 @,@ 799 . these were minted for various public events , did not circulate , and none used longacre \\'s design . \\n  = johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction = \\n  the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction ( sometimes referred to as the corey – chaykovsky reaction or ccr ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides , aziridines , and cyclopropanes . it was discovered in 1961 by a. william johnson and developed significantly by e. j. corey and michael chaykovsky . the reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone , aldehyde , imine , or enone to produce the corresponding 3 @-@ membered ring . the reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry . the synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins . \\n  the reaction is most often employed for epoxidation via methylene transfer , and to this end has been used in several notable total syntheses ( see synthesis of epoxides below ) . additionally detailed below are the history , mechanism , scope , and enantioselective variants of the reaction . several reviews have been published . \\n  = = history = = \\n  the original publication by johnson concerned the reaction of 9 @-@ dimethylsulfonium fluorenylide with substituted benzaldehyde derivatives . the attempted wittig @-@ like reaction failed and a benzalfluorene oxide was obtained instead , noting that \" reaction between the sulfur ylid and benzaldehydes did not afford benzalfluorenes as had the phosphorus and arsenic ylids . \" \\n  the subsequent development of ( dimethyloxosulfaniumyl ) methanide , ( ch3 ) 2soch2 and ( dimethylsulfaniumyl ) methanide , ( ch3 ) 2sch2 ( known as corey – chaykovsky reagents ) by corey and chaykovsky as efficient methylene @-@ transfer reagents established the reaction as a part of the organic canon . \\n  = = mechanism = = \\n  the reaction mechanism for the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine group . a negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring . in the related wittig reaction , the formation of the much stronger phosphorus @-@ oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead , olefination takes place through a 4 @-@ membered cyclic intermediate . \\n  the trans diastereoselectivity observed results from the reversibility of the initial addition , allowing equilibration to the favored anti betaine over the syn betaine . initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges ; density functional theory calculations have shown that the rate @-@ limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the conformer necessary for backside attack on the sulfonium . \\n  the degree of reversibility in the initial step ( and therefore the diastereoselectivity ) depends on four factors , with greater reversibility corresponding to higher selectivity : \\n  stability of the substrate with higher stability leading to greater reversibility by favoring the starting material over the betaine . \\n  stability of the ylide with higher stability similarly leading to greater reversibility . \\n  steric hindrance in the betaine with greater hindrance leading to greater reversibility by disfavoring formation of the intermediate and slowing the rate @-@ limiting rotation of the central bond . \\n  solvation of charges in the betaine by counterions such as lithium with greater solvation allowing more facile rotation in the betaine intermediate , lowering the amount of reversibility . \\n  = = scope = = \\n  the application of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is diverse . the reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications . it has seen use in a number of high @-@ profile total syntheses , as detailed below , and is generally recognized as a powerful transformative tool in the organic repertoire . \\n  = = = types of ylides = = = \\n  many types of ylides can be prepared with various functional groups both on the anionic carbon center and on the sulfur . the substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents ( typically from the sulfonium halide , e.g. trimethylsulfonium iodide ) and overall reaction rate in various ways . the general format for the reagent is shown on the right . \\n  use of a sulfoxonium allows more facile preparation of the reagent using weaker bases as compared to sulfonium ylides . ( the difference being that a sulfoxonium contains a doubly bonded oxygen whereas the sulfonium does not . ) the former react slower due to their increased stability . in addition , the dialkylsulfoxide by @-@ products of sulfoxonium reagents are greatly preferred to the significantly more toxic , volatile , and odorous dialkylsulfide by @-@ products from sulfonium reagents . \\n  the vast majority of reagents are monosubstituted at the ylide carbon ( either r1 or r2 as hydrogen ) . disubstituted reagents are much rarer but have been described : \\n  if the ylide carbon is substituted with an electron @-@ withdrawing group ( ewg ) , the reagent is referred to as a stabilized ylide . these , similarly to sulfoxonium reagents , react much slower and are typically easier to prepare . these are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish : examples involving amides are widespread , with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other ewg \\'s . for these , the related darzens reaction is typically more appropriate . \\n  if the ylide carbon is substituted with an aryl or allyl group , the reagent is referred to as a semi @-@ stabilized ylide . these have been developed extensively , second only to the classical methylene reagents ( r1 = r2 = h ) . the substitution pattern on aryl reagents can heavily influence the selectivity of the reaction as per the criteria above . \\n  if the ylide carbon is substituted with an alkyl group the reagent is referred to as an unstabilized ylide . the size of the alkyl groups are the major factors in selectivity with these reagents . \\n  the r @-@ groups on the sulfur , though typically methyls , have been used to synthesize reagents that can perform enantioselective variants of the reaction ( see variations below ) . the size of the groups can also influence diastereoselectivity in alicyclic substrates . \\n  = = = synthesis of epoxides = = = \\n  reactions of sulfur ylides with ketones and aldehydes to form epoxides are by far the most common application of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction . examples involving complex substrates and \\' exotic \\' ylides have been reported , as shown below . \\n  the reaction has been used in a number of notable total syntheses including the danishefsky taxol total synthesis , which produces the chemotherapeutic drug taxol , and the kuehne strychnine total synthesis which produces the pesticide strychnine . \\n  = = = synthesis of aziridines = = = \\n  the synthesis of aziridines from imines is another important application of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from oxaziridines . though less widely applied , the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent . the examples shown below are representative ; in the latter , an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding amine . \\n  = = = synthesis of cyclopropanes = = = \\n  for addition of sulfur ylides to enones , higher 1 @,@ 4 @-@ selectivity is typically obtained with sulfoxonium reagents than with sulfonium reagents . many electron @-@ withdrawing groups have been shown compatible with the reaction including ketones , esters , and amides ( the example below involves a weinreb amide ) . with further conjugated systems 1 @,@ 6 @-@ addition tends to predominate over 1 @,@ 4 @-@ addition . \\n  = = = other reactions = = = \\n  in addition to the reactions originally reported by johnson , corey , and chaykovsky , sulfur ylides have been used for a number of related homologation reactions that tend to be grouped under the same name . \\n  with epoxides and aziridines the reaction serves as a ring @-@ expansion to produce the corresponding oxetane or azetidine . the long reaction times required for these reactions prevent them from occurring as significant side reactions when synthesizing epoxides and aziridines . \\n  several cycloadditions wherein the ylide serves as a \" nucleophilic carbenoid equivalent \" have been reported . \\n  living polymerizations using trialkylboranes as the catalyst and ( dimethyloxosulfaniumyl ) methanide as the monomer have been reported for the synthesis of various complex polymers . \\n  = = enantioselective variations = = \\n  the development of an enantioselective ( i.e. yielding an enantiomeric excess , which is labelled as \" ee \" ) variant of the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction remains an active area of academic research . the use of chiral sulfides in a stoichiometric fashion has proved more successful than the corresponding catalytic variants , but the substrate scope is still limited in all cases . the catalytic variants have been developed almost exclusively for enantioselective purposes ; typical organosulfide reagents are not prohibitively expensive and the racemic reactions can be carried out with equimolar amounts of ylide without raising costs significantly . chiral sulfides , on the other hand , are more costly to prepare , spurring the advancement of catalytic enantioselective methods . \\n  = = = stoichiometric reagents = = = \\n  the most successful reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below . the first is a bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β @-@ adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol ( dci ) but is limited by the availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent . the synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1 @,@ 3 @-@ anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair . the conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents . \\n  the other major reagent is a camphor @-@ derived reagent developed by varinder aggarwal of the university of bristol . both enantiomers are easily synthesized , although the yields are lower than for the oxathiane reagent . the ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead hydrogens and approach of the aldehyde is blocked by the camphor moiety . the reaction employs a phosphazene base to promote formation of the ylide . \\n  = = = catalytic reagents = = = \\n  catalytic reagents have been less successful , with most variations suffering from poor yield , poor enantioselectivity , or both . there are also issues with substrate scope , most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes . the trouble stems from the need for a nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide . since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds , tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult . shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of ( e ) -stilbene oxide . \\n  aggarwal has developed an alternative method employing the same sulfide as above and a novel alkylation involving a rhodium carbenoid formed in situ . the method too has limited substrate scope , failing for any electrophiles possessing basic substituents due to competitive consumption of the carbenoid . \\n  = treaty of ciudad juárez = \\n  the treaty of ciudad juárez was a peace treaty signed between the then president of mexico , porfirio díaz , and the revolutionary francisco madero on may 21 , 1911 . the treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting madero and those of díaz and thus concluded the initial phase of the mexican revolution . \\n  the treaty stipulated that díaz , as well as his vice president ramón corral , were to step down by the end of may , and that he was to be replaced by francisco león de la barra as interim president and hold presidential elections . those who had suffered losses due to the revolution would be the indemnified , and there would be a general amnesty . díaz resigned on may 25 , and interim president francisco león de la barra was the new incumbent . díaz and his family , his vice president corral , plus josé yves limantour and rosendo pineda left mexico for exile . \\n  significantly , the treaty did not mention or institute any social reforms that madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions . it also left the porfirian state essentially intact . additionally , madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to be settled through the courts , staffed by the old judges , a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence , particularly in rural areas . \\n  on june 7 , 1911 , madero entered mexico city . in october 1911 he was elected president , under the banner of the partido constitucional progresista , along with josé maría pino suárez , his new running mate as vice @-@ president . madero pushed aside francisco vázquez gómez , the vice presidential candidate for the anti @-@ reelectionist party in 1910 , as being too moderate . \\n  = = military developments leading up to the treaty = = \\n  the rebellion against the government of porfirio díaz broke out in late 1910 , after díaz had his rival francisco madero imprisoned and had announced his own victory in a falsified election . madero \\'s earlier vague promises of agrarian reforms had attracted many supporters . he himself escaped from prison and fled to texas , from where he issued his famous plan of san luis potosí . this manifesto called for an armed uprising against the porfiriato and establishment of free and democratic elections . as a response to madero \\'s proclamation , violent clashes began throughout mexico in november 1910 . \\n  in the guerrero district of chihuahua , pascual orozco attacked federal troops and sent dead soldiers \\' clothing back to díaz with the message , \" ahí te van las hojas , mándame más tamales \" ( \" here are the wrappers , send me more tamales . \" ) he then began operations which threatened ciudad juárez . additionally , political support for madero \\'s rebellion came from abraham gonzález , who accepted the plan of san luis potosí . \\n  at roughly the same time , agrarian unrest in the state of morelos turned into a full blown rebellion under the leadership of the zapata brothers , emiliano and eufemio . \\n  = = = orozco and villa take ciudad juárez = = = \\n  encouraged by the news of the uprisings , madero crossed the border back into mexico in february 1911 . he was joined by pancho villa and orozco and in april the army began approaching ciudad juárez . orozco and villa led the way with 500 men each , while madero followed up with 1 @,@ 500 riders . the city was besieged by the end of the month , after madero \\'s army encountered some resistance in the chihuahuan countryside . madero asked the commander of the city \\'s garrison to surrender but the latter refused , hoping that the fortifications he had constructed would allow him to defend the city until reinforcements arrived . concerned also with the possibility that a direct attack on the town would cause artillery shells to cross the border into the united states which could provoke an outside intervention , and faced with a series of peace proposals from díaz , madero hesitated in attacking the city . he in fact ordered his commanders to lift the siege . orozco , however disregarded the order and , joined by villa , attacked . after two days of fighting the city fell to the insurrectionists . madero intervened personally to spare the life of the city \\'s commander , gen. navarro , whom both orozco and villa wanted executed for his previous killing of rebel pows . this , coupled with the fact that both leaders were ignored by madero in his political appointments , outraged and estranged them from him . \\n  = = = zapata in south and central mexico = = = \\n  at about the same time that villa and orozco were marching on ciudad juárez , the zapatista revolt gathered strength and spread to the states of puebla , tlaxcala , mexico , michoacán and guerrero . on april 14 , madero had emiliano zapata officially designated as his representative in the region . however , zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in morelos by the time that madero concluded negotiations with díaz , the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of morelos would be ignored or sidelined . zapata \\'s first military action was to take the town of chinameca where he obtained essential supplies . subsequently zapata , for political and strategic reasons , decided to attack the city of cuautla . in order to mislead his opponents however , he initially attacked and captured the towns of izúcar de matamoros ( which was subsequently retaken by federal forces ) and chietla . from there he made a wide circle around cuautla and captured yautepec and jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies , munitions and soldiers . by may , out of all the major urban centers in the region , only cuautla and the capital of morelos , cuernavaca , remained outside of his control . \\n  zapata began the attack on cuautla on may 13 with 4000 troops against 400 elite soldiers of the so @-@ called \" golden fifth \" ; the fifth cavalry regiment of the federal army . the battle took almost a week and has been described as \" six of the most terrible days of battle in the whole revolution \" . it consisted of house to house fighting , hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , and no quarter given by either side . general victoriano huerta arrived in nearby cuernavaca with 600 reinforcements , but decided not to come to the relief of cuautla as he was afraid that the capital would revolt in his absence . on may 19 , the remains of the \" golden fifth \" pulled out of the town which was then occupied by zapata \\'s soldiers . \\n  the successful capture of cuautla made zapata a hero to ordinary people throughout mexico and new corridos were written about him . after zapata \\'s taking of cuautla , the federal government controlled only five states and some urban areas . porfirio díaz himself later stated that , while he felt that he could defend against villa and orozco in chihuahua , the fall of cuautla was the event which persuaded him to agree to peace with madero . \\n  = = the compromise = = \\n  as early as march 1911 , madero \\'s representatives met in new york with díaz \\'s finance minister , josé yves limantour , and the mexican ambassador to the us in order to discuss the possibility of peace between the two sides . limantour proposed an end to the hostilities and offered an amnesty for all revolutionaries , the resignation of the then vice president ramón corral , the replacement of four díaz cabinet ministers and ten state governors by ones chosen by madero , and the establishment of the principle of \" no @-@ reelection \" which would prevent díaz from seeking yet another term as president ( which would have been his ninth ) . madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by díaz . \\n  faced with the siege of ciudad juárez and the outbreak of rebellion in morelos , díaz and members of his cabinet became more willing to negotiate and launched a \" skillful peace offensive \" aimed at madero . this was largely a result of panic among the large landowners associated with the díaz regime ( the hacendados ) and the financial elite , which represented a \" moderate \" wing within the government . some among the porfiristas in fact , expected that zapata would soon march on mexico city itself , unless peace was concluded with madero . \\n  the moderate view within the díaz government was represented by jorge vera estañol who in a memo to the minister of foreign affairs wrote that there were two revolutions taking place in mexico : a political revolution , based mostly in the north , whose aim was mostly to establish free elections and remove díaz himself from power , and a social revolution whose aim was \" anarchy \" which was spreading throughout the mexican countryside . estañol recommended coming to terms with the first group of revolutionaries , by agreeing to the principle of no re @-@ election and a general amnesty , in order to prevent the second group from succeeding . in addition to his fear of \" anarchy \" , estañol was also worried that the social revolution would lead to a military intervention by the united states . \\n  estañol \\'s views represented those of the portion of the upper class which was willing to come to terms with at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings , as exemplified by those of zapata , which were erupting throughout mexico . limantour , who broadly agreed with estañol , had the support of the mexican financiers , who feared the downgrading of mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest , as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings . \\n  these social group were in turn opposed by the more reactionary elements within díaz \\'s government , mostly concentrated in the federal army , who though that the rebels should be dealt with through brute force . this faction was represented by general victoriano huerta , who would later carry out an attempted coup d \\'état against madero . likewise , the general , and potential successor to díaz , bernardo reyes stated in a letter to limantour that \" the repression ( against the insurrectionists ) should be carried out with the greates energy , punishing without any pity anyone participating in the armed struggle \" . in the end however , díaz dismissed the advice from his generals as \" custer @-@ like bluster \" and chose to seek peace with the moderate wing of the revolution . limantour had finally managed to persuade him to resign . \\n  at the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels . the \" left wing \" of the revolutionary movement , represented by zapata and orozco ( villa for the time being tended to support madero ) , warned against any possible compromises with díaz . in the end their suspicions proved correct as the treaty that was eventually signed neglected issues of social and agrarian land reform that were central to their struggle . \\n  = = the treaty \\'s terms = = \\n  the most significant point of the treaty was that porfirio díaz , and his vice president , ramón corral , resign and that de la barra , acting as interim president organize free elections as soon as possible . \\n  additionally , the treaty stipulated that : \\n  an amnesty for all revolutionaries be declared , with the option for some of them to apply for membership in the rurales . \\n  the revolutionary forces were to be demobilized as soon as possible and the federal forces were to be the only army in mexico . this was in order to appease the army , which had opposed a compromise with madero . \\n  madero and his supporters had the right to name fourteen provisional state governors , and to approve la barra \\'s cabinet . \\n  pensions were to be established for relatives of the soldiers who had died fighting the rebels . \\n  policemen and judges , as well as state legislators , that had been appointed or \" elected \" under díaz were to retain their offices . \\n  = = implementation and results = = \\n  the treaty was signed on may 21 . díaz resigned accordingly on may 25 . francisco de la barra became the interim president . madero entered mexico city on june 7 . \\n  zapata however refused to recognize the interim government of de la barra , and for the time being the fighting in morelos continued . madero met with zapata on several occasions during june . while initially zapata trusted madero , with time he became increasingly concerned that the goals of \" his revolution \" were not being fulfilled . he was particularly angry that madero did not plan on carrying out any kind of agrarian reform , or the breakup of large hacendias . additionally , the press in mexico city , controlled by the landowners began referring to zapata as a bandit and federal generals , such as huerta , continued attacking his troops under the pretext that zapata failed to demobilize in violation of the treaty . sporadic fighting in southern mexico continued . in november 1911 , shortly after madero \\'s inauguration , zapata issued the famous plan of ayala , in which the zapatistas denounced madero and instead recognized pascual orozco as the rightful president and leader of the revolution . \\n  madero also earned the great displeasure of other revolutionaries , including , pascual orozco . madero \\'s first act after the treaty was signed was a gesture of reconciliation with the díaz regime . as a result of the treaty he was given the right to appoint members of the la barra cabinet . he chose mostly upper class maderistas , including his wife for the post in the treasury . he also maintained the existing federal system , by keeping the sitting judges of the supreme court , the legislators in federal and state assemblies and the bureaucrats of the various federal agencies . venustiano carranza , who was going to become a major revolutionary in his own right and a future president of mexico , stated that , after the treaty , madero had \" deliver ( ed ) to the reactionaries a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again \" . díaz , after leaving for exile in france , observed that \" madero has unleashed a tiger , let us see if he can control him \" . \\n  orozco , who saw himself as being instrumental in madero \\'s victory over díaz , was merely appointed as a commander of the rurales in chihuahua , which increased his resentment . when he tried to run for governor of the state , madero supported his opponent , abraham gonzález and eventually pressured orozco to drop out of the race . when , in the aftermath of the plan of ayala , madero ordered orozco to lead federal troops to suppress zapata , orozco refused . in march 1912 , orozco issued his plan of empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against madero . \\n  = the feast of the goat = \\n  the feast of the goat ( spanish : la fiesta del chivo , 2000 ) is a novel by the peruvian nobel prize in literature laureate mario vargas llosa . the book is set in the dominican republic and portrays the assassination of dominican dictator rafael trujillo , and its aftermath , from two distinct standpoints a generation apart : during and immediately after the assassination itself , in may 1961 ; and thirty five years later , in 1996 . throughout , there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship , in the 1950s , and its significance for the island and its inhabitants . \\n  the novel follows three interwoven storylines . the first concerns a woman , urania cabral , who is back in the dominican republic , after a long absence , to visit her ailing father ; she ends up recalling incidents from her youth and recounting a long @-@ held secret to her aunt and cousins . the second story line focuses on the last day in trujillo \\'s life from the moment he wakes up onwards , and shows us the regime \\'s inner circle , to which urania \\'s father once belonged . the third strand depicts trujillo \\'s assassins , many of whom had previously been government loyalists , as they wait for his car late that night ; after the assassination , this story line shows us the assassins \\' persecution . each aspect of the book \\'s plot reveals a different viewpoint on the dominican republic \\'s political and social environment , past and present . \\n  readers are shown the regime \\'s downward spiral , trujillo \\'s assassination , and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders , conspirators , and a middle @-@ aged woman looking back . the novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power , including its psychological effects , and its long @-@ term impact . the novel \\'s themes include the nature of power and corruption , and their relationship to machismo and sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles . memory , and the process of remembering , is also an important theme , especially in urania \\'s narrative as she recalls her youth in the dominican republic . her story ( and the book as a whole ) ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of 14 . the book itself serves as a reminder of the atrocities of dictatorship , to ensure that the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation . \\n  vargas llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events : the book is not a documentary , and the cabral family , for instance , is completely fictional . on the other hand , the characters of trujillo and trujillo \\'s assassins are drawn from the historical record ; vargas llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people \\'s stories , to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked . in vargas llosa \\'s words , \" it \\'s a novel , not a history book , so i took many , many liberties . [ . . . ] i have respected the basic facts , but i have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive — and i have not exaggerated . \" \\n  the feast of the goat received largely positive reviews , with several reviewers commenting on the book \\'s depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power , and on the graphic descriptions of violent events . \\n  a film version of the novel was released in 2005 , starring isabella rossellini , paul freeman , and tomas milian . jorge alí triana and his daughter veronica triana wrote a theatrical adaptation in 2003 . \\n  = = background = = \\n  the feast of the goat is only the second of vargas llosa \\'s novels to be set outside peru ( the first being the war of the end of the world ) . it is also unusual because it is the first to have a female protagonist : as critic lynn walford writes of the leading character in the feast of the goat , and also vargas llosa \\'s subsequent book the way to paradise , \" both are utterly unlike any of the other female characters in his previous novels \" . \\n  the novel examines the dictatorial regime of rafael leónidas trujillo molina in the dominican republic . trujillo was , in historian eric roorda \\'s words , \" a towering influence in dominican and caribbean history \" who presided over \" one of the most durable regimes of the twentieth century \" during the thirty @-@ one years between his seizure of power in 1930 and his assassination in 1961 . trujillo had trained with the united states marine corps during the united states occupation of the island , and graduated from the haina military academy in 1921 . after the u.s. departed in 1924 , he became head of the dominican national police which , under his command , was transformed into the dominican national army and trujillo \\'s personal \" virtually autonomous power base \" . \\n  trujillo was officially dictator only from 1930 to 1938 , and from 1942 to 1952 , but remained in effective power throughout the entire period . though his regime was broadly nationalist , daniel chirot comments that he had \" no particular ideology \" and that his economic and social policies were basically progressive . \\n  the novel \\'s title is taken from the popular dominican merengue mataron al chivo ( \" they killed the goat \" ) , which refers to trujillo \\'s assassination on may 30 , 1961 . merengue is a style of music created by ñico lora in the 1920s and actively promoted by trujillo himself ; it is now considered the country \\'s national music . cultural critics julie sellers and stephen ropp comment about this particular merengue that , by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could be turned into a stew ( as frequently happened with goats struck down on the dominican republic \\'s highways ) , the song \" gave those performing , listening to and dancing to this merengue a sense of control over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades . \" vargas llosa quotes the lyrics to mataron al chivo at the beginning of the novel . \\n  = = plot summary = = \\n  the novel \\'s narrative is divided into three distinct strands . one is centred on urania cabral , a fictional dominican character ; another deals with the conspirators involved in trujillo \\'s assassination ; and the third focuses on trujillo himself . the novel alternates between these storylines , and also jumps back and forth from 1961 to 1996 , with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in trujillo \\'s regime . \\n  the feast of the goat begins with the return of urania to her hometown of santo domingo , a city which had been renamed ciudad trujillo during trujillo \\'s time in power . this storyline is largely introspective and deals with urania \\'s memories and her inner turmoil over the events preceding her departure from the dominican republic thirty @-@ five years earlier . urania escaped the crumbling trujillo regime in 1961 by claiming she planned to study under the tutelage of nuns in michigan . in the following decades , she becomes a prominent and successful new york lawyer . she finally returns to the dominican republic in 1996 , on a whim , and finds herself compelled to confront her father and elements of her past she has long ignored . as urania speaks to her ailing father , agustin cabral , she recalls more and more of the anger and disgust that led to her thirty @-@ five years of silence . urania retells her father \\'s descent into political disgrace , and the betrayal that forms the crux of both urania \\'s storyline and that of trujillo himself . \\n  the second and third storylines are set in 1961 , in the weeks prior to and following trujillo \\'s assassination on 30 may . each assassin has his own background story , explaining his motivation for his involvement in the assassination plot . each has been wronged by trujillo and his regime , by torture and brutality , or through assaults on their pride , their religious faith , their morality , or their loved ones . vargas llosa weaves the tale of the men as memories recalled on the night of trujillo \\'s death , as the conspirators lie in wait for \" the goat \" . interconnected with these stories are the actions of other famous trujillistas of the time : joaquín balaguer , the puppet president ; johnny abbes garcía , the merciless head of the military intelligence service ( sim ) ; and various others — some real , some composites of historical figures , and some purely fictional . \\n  the third storyline is concerned with the thoughts and motives of rafael leónidas trujillo molina himself . the chapters concerning the goat recall the major events of his time , including the slaughter of thousands of dominican haitians in 1937 . they also deal with the dominican republic \\'s tense international relationships during the cold war , especially with the united states under the presidency of john f. kennedy , and cuba under castro . vargas llosa also speculates upon trujillo \\'s innermost thoughts and paints a picture of a man whose physical body is failing him . trujillo is tormented by incontinence and impotence ; and this storyline intersects with urania \\'s narrative when it is revealed that urania was sexually assaulted by trujillo . he is unable to achieve an erection with urania , and in frustration and anger he rapes her with his hands . this event is the core of urania \\'s shame , and her hatred towards her father . in addition , it is the cause of trujillo \\'s repeated anger over the \" anemic little bitch \" that witnessed his impotence and emotion , and the reason he is en route to sleep with another girl on the night of his assassination . \\n  in the novel \\'s final chapters , the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency . the tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the sim , the failure of the coup , the rape of urania , and the concessions made to trujillo \\'s most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country . the book ends as urania prepares to return home , determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island . \\n  = = characters = = \\n  = = = modern day = = = \\n  urania cabral and her father agustín cabral appear in both the modern day and historical portions of the novel . in the year 1996 , urania returns to the dominican republic for the first time since her departure at the age of 14 . she is a successful new york lawyer who has spent most of the past 35 years trying to overcome the traumas of her childhood , a goal she pursues through an academic fascination with trujillo and dominican history . urania is deeply troubled by the events of her past , and is compelled to confront her father agustín about his role in those events . urania visits her father , finding him weakened by age and a severe stroke , so much so that he is barely able to respond physically to her presence , let alone speak . agustín listens helplessly as urania recounts his past as \" egghead cabral \" , a high @-@ ranking member of trujillo \\'s inner circle , and his drastic fall from grace . urania details agustín \\'s role in the events that led to her rape by the dominican leader , and to her subsequent lifetime of celibacy and emotional trauma . agustín \\'s character in the modern day portion of the novel serves primarily as a sounding board for urania \\'s recollections of the trujillo era and the events that surrounded both agustín cabral \\'s disgrace and urania \\'s escape from the country . his responses are minimal and non @-@ vocal , despite the ardency of urania \\'s accusations and the enormity of his own actions during trujillo \\'s reign . \\n  = = = the trujillo regime = = = \\n  rafael trujillo , known also as the goat , the chief , and the benefactor , is a fictionalized character based on the real dictator of the dominican republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official president of the republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952 . in the feast of the goat , vargas llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator , and retells the goat \\'s last hours from his own perspective . trujillo \\'s character struggles with aging and the physical problems of incontinence and impotence . through fictional events and first person narrative , the reader is given insight into the man who , during his \" thirty @-@ one years of horrendous political crimes \" , modernized the country \\'s infrastructure and military , but whose regime \\'s attacks against its enemies overseas ( particularly the attempted assassination of rómulo betancourt , president of venezuela ) led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the dominican republic by the organization of american states in the 1950s . the resultant economic downturn , in conjunction with other factors , leads to the cia supported assassination plot that ends trujillo \\'s life on may 30 , 1961 . \\n  trujillo \\'s regime is supported by johnny abbes garcía , the head of the military intelligence service ( sim ) , a brutal man to whom many \" disappearances , ... executions , ... sudden falls into disgrace \" are attributed . abbes and his intelligence officers are notorious for their cruelty , particularly their habit of killing dissidents by throwing them into shark @-@ infested waters . colonel abbes \" may be the devil , but he \\'s useful to the chief ; everything bad is attributed to him and only the good to trujillo \" . trujillo \\'s son , ramfis trujillo , is a loyal supporter of the chief . after unsuccessful attempts at schooling in the united states , ramfis returns to the dominican republic to serve in his father \\'s military . he is a well @-@ known womanizer . upon trujillo \\'s death , ramfis seeks revenge , even going so far as to torture and kill his uncle by marriage , general jose roman , for his part in the assassination conspiracy . \\n  joaquín balaguer , trujillo \\'s puppet president is also a supporter , and initially his seemingly innocuous character holds no real power . following trujillo \\'s death , the calm and serenity of balaguer bring about real change in his character , and general román comments that \" this insignificant man whom everyone had always considered a mere clerk , a purely decorative figure in the regime , began to acquire surprising authority \" . it is balaguer who guides much of the action in the last sections of the book . \\n  = = = conspirators = = = \\n  the storyline concerning the assassination primarily follows the four conspirators who directly participate in trujillo \\'s death . antonio imbert barrera is one of the few conspirators who survives the violent reprisals that follow trujillo \\'s assassination . imbert is a politician who becomes disillusioned with the deception and cruelty of the trujillo regime . his first plan to kill trujillo was foiled by the unsuccessful attempted overthrow of the regime by cuban paramilitary forces . now convinced of the difficulty of his task , imbert joins the other conspirators in plotting trujillo \\'s death . among the others is antonio de la maza , one of trujillo \\'s personal guards . antonio \\'s brother is killed as part of a government cover @-@ up and antonio swears revenge upon trujillo . salvador estrella sadhalá , known as \" turk \" , is a devout catholic who , in indignation at the regime \\'s many crimes against god , swears an oath against trujillo . turk eventually turns himself in for fear that the regime was torturing his family . both turk and his innocent brother are then tortured for months . his father remains loyal to trujillo and disowns turk to his face . despite all of this , turk refuses to commit suicide and does not lose faith in god . he is later executed by ramfis and other high level government men . turk \\'s close friend , amado garcía guerrero , known as amadito , is a lieutenant in the army who gave up his beloved as proof of his loyalty to trujillo , and then later was forced to kill her brother to prove himself to trujillo . amadito \\'s disgust with himself and disillusionment with the regime lead to his decision to help to kill trujillo . following the assassination he hides out with de la maza and dies fighting . in the aftermath of the assassination , amadito and antonio de la maza choose to fight the members of sim who come to arrest them , opting to die in battle rather than be captured and tortured . \\n  = = major themes = = \\n  the feast of the goat \\'s major themes include political corruption , machismo , memory , and writing and power . olga lorenzo , reviewer for the melbourne age , suggests that overall vargas llosa \\'s aim is to reveal the irrational forces of latin tradition that give rise to despotism . \\n  = = = political corruption = = = \\n  the structure of dominican society was hierarchical , with strongly gendered roles . rafael trujillo , the ruler , was a cruel dictator who haunts the people of santo domingo even 35 years after his death . he is a true caudillo , ruling with brutality and corruption . he creates a personality cult in his capitalist society and encourages decadence within his regime . prior to promotion to a position of responsibility , an officer is required to pass a \" test of loyalty \" . his people are to remain loyal to him all cost , and are periodically tested by public humiliation and censure even though acts of disloyalty were rare . trujillo violates women and children as an expression of political and sexual power , and in some cases takes the wife or child of his lieutenants , many of whom still remain blindly loyal . even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the tyrant for pleasure . \\n  many of the assassins had belonged to the trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters , only to find their support for him eroded by the state \\'s crimes against its people . imbert , one of the assassins , sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the mirabal sisters : \" they kill our fathers , our brothers , our friends . and now they \\'re killing our women . and here we sit , resigned , waiting our turn . \" in an interview , vargas llosa describes the corruption and brutality of trujillo \\'s regime : \" he had more or less all the common traits of a latin american dictator , but pushed to the extreme . in cruelty , i think he went far far away from the rest — and in corruption , too . \" \\n  = = = machismo = = = \\n  according to literary scholar peter anthony niessa , the two important components of machismo are aggressive behaviour and hyper @-@ sexuality . aggressive behaviour is exhibited by displays of power and strength , while hyper @-@ sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many partners as possible . these two components shape the portrayal of trujillo and his regime in the feast of the goat . as lorenzo observes , vargas llosa \" reveals traditions of machismo , of abusive fathers , and of child @-@ rearing practices that repeat the shaming of children , so that each generation bequeaths a withering of the soul to the subsequent one . \" \\n  in a display of both aspects of machismo , trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters . mario vargas llosa wrote of trujillo \\'s machismo and treatment of women , \" [ h ] e went to bed with his ministers \\' wives , not only because he liked these ladies but because it was a way to test his ministers . he wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation . mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque role — and they remained loyal to trujillo even after his death . \" trujillo \\'s sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo . in niessa \\'s words , \" the implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance . \" \\n  trujillo \\'s attempted sexual conquest of urania is an example of both political manipulation of agustín cabral and sexual power over young women . however , as trujillo \\'s penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl , the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo . \\n  = = = memory = = = \\n  all of the novel \\'s storylines concern memory in some sense or another . the most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of urania cabral , who has returned to the dominican republic for the first time in 30 years , and is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at 14 . she was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the dictator himself , a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again , a fact to which she alludes throughout the book , but which is only revealed at the very end : the book concludes with her recounting the memory of that night to her aunt and cousins , who never knew the true reason she left the country . when her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details , she responds that while she forgets many things , \" i remember everything about that night . \" for urania , forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable . her father , on the other hand , is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering , since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking ; however , urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them . \\n  memory is also important in the sections of the novel that deal with the assassins . each recalls the events that led him to take part in the assassination of trujillo . these incidents included the 1956 galindez kidnapping and murder , the 1960 murder of the mirabal sisters , and the 1961 split with the catholic church . these historical events are used by vargas llosa to connect the assassins with specific moments that demonstrate the violence of trujillo \\'s regime . trujillo , too , is shown reflecting on the past , not least his own formation and training at the hands of the us marines . \\n  but above all mario vargas llosa uses the fictional urania to facilitate the novel \\'s attempt at remembering the regime . the novel opens and closes with urania \\'s story , effectively framing the narrative in the terms of remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present . in addition , because of her academic study of the history of the trujillo regime , urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole . this is in keeping with one purpose of the book , which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation . \\n  = = = writing and power = = = \\n  in her treatment of the novel , maría regina ruiz claims that power gives its wielder the ability to make prohibitions ; prohibitions that are reflected in history , the study of which reveals what is and what is not told . the government \\'s actions in the feast of the goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition : foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering trujillo \\'s country as they were seen as a threat to the government \\'s ideas . mario vargas llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited . \\n  ruiz notes that writing also has the power to transform reality . it brings the reader back to the past , allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians . ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one \\'s understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism , and argues that the feast of the goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation . \\n  the construction of fictions surrounding the events of trujillo \\'s regime allow a degree of freedom from the horrors that took places . author julia alvarez contends that these events can \" only finally be understood by fiction , only finally be redeemed by the imagination \" , while richard patterson claims that vargas llosa \" reconfigures , and to a large degree demythologizes \" trujillo and his brutal reign through use of narrative structure . vargas llosa \\'s writing acts as a cathartic force for this period in history . \\n  = = fact and fiction = = \\n  the novel is a combination of fact and fiction . blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel , but especially in the feast of the goat because vargas llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters . some characters are fictional , and those that are non @-@ fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book . the general details of the assassination are true , and the assassins are all real people . while they lie in wait for the dictator to arrive , they recount actual crimes of the regime , such as the murder of the mirabal sisters . however , other details are invented by vargas llosa , such as amadito \\'s murder of the brother of the woman he loved . \\n  those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people . president balaguer is real , but the entire cabral family is completely fictional . according to wolff , vargas llosa \" uses history as a starting point in constructing a fictionalized account of trujillo \\'s \" spiritual colonization \" of the dominican republic as experienced by one dominican family . the fictional cabral family allows vargas llosa to show two sides of the trujillo regime : through agustin , the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation ; through urania , the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind . vargas llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non @-@ fictional , especially those of the goat himself . according to literary scholar richard patterson , \" vargas llosa \\'s expands all the way into the very \" dark area \" of trujillo \\'s consciousness ( as the storyteller dares to conceive it ) . \" \\n  vargas llosa also built an image of the regime with the troubled historical events . with regard to the historical accuracy of the book , vargas llosa has said \" it \\'s a novel , not a history book , so i took many , many liberties . the only limitation i imposed on myself was that i was not going to invent anything that couldn \\'t have happened within the framework of life in the dominican republic . i have respected the basic facts , but i have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive — and i have not exaggerated . \" \\n  = = critical reception = = \\n  the realist style of the feast of the goat is recognized by some reviewers as being a break from a more allegorical approach to the dictator novel . the novel received largely positive reviews , most of which were willing to accept sacrifices of historical accuracy in favour of good storytelling . \\n  a common comment on the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder which are depicted in the novel . vargas lets the reader see the realities of an oppressive regime with a degree of detail not often used by his compatriots in latin american literature , as michael wood suggests in the london review of books : \" vargas llosa ... tells us far more about the details of day @-@ to @-@ day intrigue , and the sordid , sadistic minutiae of torture and murder . \" walter kirn of the new york times suggests that the \" grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions \" cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light , draining them of their significance and impact . similarly , kirn implies that the \" narrative machinery \" mentioned by wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline . the plot line centered on urania cabral is described by sturrock as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel , and wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention . in contrast , kirn \\'s review states that urania \\'s segments are \" talky and atmospheric ... [ and ] seem to be on loan from another sort of book . \" \\n  most reviews of the feast of the goat make either indirect of direct reference to the relationship between sexuality and power . salon reviewer laura miller , writer for the observer jonathan heawood , walter kirn , and michael wood each detail the connection between trujillo \\'s gradual loss of ultimate control , both over his body and his followers . the means by which trujillo reinforces political power through sexual acts and begins to lose personal conviction as his body fails him are topics of frequent discussion among reviewers . \\n  in 2011 bernard diederich , author of the 1978 non @-@ fiction book trujillo . the death of the goat , accused vargas @-@ llosa of plagiarism . \\n  = = adaptations = = \\n  an english @-@ language film adaptation of the novel was made in 2005 , directed by luis llosa , mario vargas llosa \\'s cousin . it stars isabella rossellini as urania cabral , paul freeman as her father agustin , stephanie leonidas as uranita and tomas milian as rafael leonidas trujillo . it was filmed in both the dominican republic and in spain . reviewing the film for the trade paper variety , critic jonathan holland called it \" less a feast than a somewhat rushed , but thoroughly enjoyable , three @-@ course meal \" , commenting that the main difference from the source novel was the sacrifice of psychological nuance . \\n  the novel has also been adapted for the stage , by jorge alí triana and his daughter veronica triana , directed by jorge triana : the play was put on ( in spanish , but with simultaneous translation to english ) at repertorio español ( www.repertorio.org / chivo ) in new york in 2003 ; and the production moved to lima in 2007 . a feature of the novel \\'s stage version is that the same actor plays both agustin cabral and rafael trujillo . for reviewer bruce weber , this makes the point \" that trujillo \\'s control of the nation depended on gutless collaborators \" . \\n  = charles eaton ( raaf officer ) = \\n  charles eaton , obe , afc ( 21 december 1895 – 12 november 1979 ) was a senior officer and aviator in the royal australian air force ( raaf ) , who later served as a diplomat . born in london , he joined the british army upon the outbreak of world war i and saw action on the western front before transferring to the royal flying corps in 1917 . posted as a bomber pilot to no. 206 squadron , he was twice captured by german forces , and twice escaped . eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in india until moving to australia in 1923 . two years later he joined the raaf , serving initially as an instructor at no. 1 flying training school . between 1929 and 1931 , he was chosen to lead three expeditions to search for lost aircraft in central australia , gaining national attention and earning the air force cross for his \" zeal and devotion to duty \" . \\n  in 1939 , on the eve of world war ii , eaton became the inaugural commanding officer of no. 12 ( general purpose ) squadron at the newly established raaf station darwin in northern australia . promoted group captain the following year , he was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire in 1942 . he took command of no. 79 wing at batchelor , northern territory , in 1943 , and was mentioned in despatches during operations in the south west pacific . retiring from the raaf in december 1945 , eaton took up diplomatic posts in the dutch east indies , heading a united nations commission as consul @-@ general during the indonesian national revolution . he returned to australia in 1950 , and served in canberra for a further two years . popularly known as \" moth \" eaton , he was a farmer in later life , and died in 1979 at the age of 83 . he is commemorated by several memorials in the northern territory . \\n  = = early life and world war i = = \\n  charles eaton was born on 21 december 1895 in lambeth , london , the son of william walpole eaton , a butcher , and his wife grace . schooled in wandsworth , charles worked in battersea town council from the age of fourteen , before joining the london regiment upon the outbreak of world war i in august 1914 . attached to a bicycle company in the 24th battalion of the 47th division , he arrived at the western front in march 1915 . he took part in trench bombing missions and attacks on enemy lines of communication , seeing action in the battles of aubers ridge , festubert , loos , and the somme . \\n  on 14 may 1915 , eaton transferred to the royal flying corps ( rfc ) , undergoing initial pilot training at oxford . while he was landing his maurice farman shorthorn at the end of his first solo flight , another student collided with him and was killed , but eaton emerged uninjured . he was commissioned in august and was awarded his wings in october . ranked lieutenant , he served with no. 110 squadron , which operated martinsyde g.100 \" elephant \" fighters out of sedgeford , defending london against zeppelin airships . transferred to the newly formed royal air force ( raf ) in april 1918 , he was posted the following month to france flying airco dh.9 single @-@ engined bombers with no. 206 squadron . on 29 june , he was shot down behind enemy lines and captured in the vicinity of nieppe . incarcerated in holzminden prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp , germany , eaton escaped but was recaptured and court @-@ martialled , after which he was kept in solitary confinement . he later effected another escape and succeeded in rejoining his squadron in the final days of the war . \\n  = = between the wars = = \\n  eaton remained in the raf following the cessation of hostilities . he married beatrice godfrey in st. thomas \\'s church at shepherd \\'s bush , london , on 11 january 1919 . posted to no. 1 squadron , he was a pilot on the first regular passenger service between london and paris , ferrying delegates to and from the peace conference at versailles . eaton was sent to india in december to undertake aerial survey work , including the first such survey of the himalayas . he resigned from the raf in july 1920 , remaining in india to take up employment with the imperial forest service . after successfully applying for a position with the queensland forestry service , he and his family migrated to australia in 1923 . moving to south yarra , victoria , he enlisted as a flying officer in the royal australian air force ( raaf ) at laverton on 14 august 1925 . he was posted to no. 1 flying training school at raaf point cook , as a flight instructor , where he became known as a strict disciplinarian who \" trained his pilots well \" . here eaton acquired his nickname of \" moth \" , the air force \\'s basic trainer at this time being the de havilland dh.60 moth . promoted flight lieutenant in february 1928 , he flew a moth in the 1929 east @-@ west air race from sydney to perth , as part of the celebrations for the western australia centenary ; he was the sixth competitor across the line , after fellow rfc veteran jerry pentland . \\n  regarded as one of the raaf \\'s most skilful cross @-@ country pilots and navigators , eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in central australia between 1929 and 1931 . in april 1929 , he coordinated the air force \\'s part in the search for aviators keith anderson and bob hitchcock , missing in their aircraft the kookaburra while themselves looking for charles kingsford smith and charles ulm , who had force landed the southern cross in north western australia during a flight from sydney . three of the raaf \\'s five \" ancient \" dh.9 biplanes went down in the search — though all crews escaped injury — including eaton \\'s , which experienced what he labelled \" a good crash \" on 21 april near tennant creek after the engine \\'s pistons melted . the same day , captain lester brain , flying a qantas aircraft , located the wreck of the kookaburra in the tanami desert , approximately 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) east @-@ south @-@ east of wave hill . setting out from wave hill on 23 april , eaton led a ground party across rough terrain that reached the crash site four days later and buried the crew , who had perished of thirst and exposure . not a particularly religious man , he recalled that after the burial he saw a perfect cross formed by cirrus cloud in an otherwise clear blue sky above the kookaburra . the air board described the raaf \\'s search as taking 240 hours flying time \" under the most trying conditions ... where a forced landing meant certain crash \" . in november 1930 , eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near ayers rock , but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in alice springs . the next month , he was ordered to search for w.l. pittendrigh and s.j. hamre , who had disappeared in the biplane golden quest 2 while attempting to discover lasseter \\'s reef . employing a total of four dh.60 moths , the raaf team located the missing men near dashwood creek on 7 january 1931 , and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by eaton . staying in nearby alice springs , he recommended a site for the town \\'s new airfield , which was approved and has remained in use since its construction . \\n  eaton was awarded the air force cross on 10 march 1931 \" in recognition of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to central australia in search of missing aviators \" . the media called him the \" \\' knight errant \\' of the desert skies \" . aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the kookaburra , eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he was test flying the wackett warrigal i with sergeant eric douglas . having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover , eaton called on douglas to bail out . when douglas stood up to do so , the spin stopped , apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane . eaton then managed to land the aeroplane , he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience . in december 1931 , he was posted to no. 1 aircraft depot at laverton , where he continued to fly as well as performing administrative work . promoted squadron leader in 1936 , he undertook a clandestine mission around the new year to scout for suitable landing grounds in the dutch east indies , primarily timor and ambon . wearing civilian clothes , he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in koepang , dutch timor . eaton was appointed commanding officer ( co ) of no. 21 squadron in may 1937 , one of his first tasks being to undertake another aerial search in central australia , this time for prospector sir herbert gepp , who was subsequently discovered alive and well . later that year , eaton presided over the court of inquiry into the crash of a hawker demon biplane in victoria , recommending a gallantry award for aircraftman william mcaloney , who had leapt into the demon \\'s burning wreckage in an effort to rescue its pilot ; mcaloney subsequently received the albert medal for his heroism . \\n  following a 1937 decision to establish the first north australian raaf base , in april 1938 eaton , now on the headquarters staff of raaf station laverton , and wing commander george jones , director of personnel services at raaf headquarters , began developing plans for the new station , to be commanded by jones , and a new squadron that would be based there , led by eaton . the next month they flew an avro anson on an inspection tour of darwin , northern territory , site of the proposed base . delays meant that no. 12 ( general purpose ) squadron was not formed until 6 february 1939 at laverton . jones had by now moved on to another posting but eaton took up the squadron \\'s command as planned . promoted to wing commander on 1 march , he and his equipment officer , flying officer hocking , were ordered to build up the unit as quickly as possible , and established an initial complement of fourteen officers and 120 airmen , plus four ansons and four demons , within a week . an advance party of thirty ncos and airmen under hocking began moving to darwin on 1 july . staff were initially accommodated in a former meatworks built during world war i , and life at the newly established air base had a \" distinctly raw , pioneering feel about it \" according to historian chris coulthard @-@ clark . morale , though , was high . on 31 august , no. 12 squadron launched its first patrol over the darwin area , flown by one of seven ansons that had so far been delivered . these were augmented by a flight of four cac wirraways ( replacing the originally planned force of demons ) that took off from laverton on 2 september , the day before australia declared war , and arrived in darwin four days later . a fifth wirraway in the flight crashed on landing at darwin , killing both crewmen . \\n  = = world war ii = = \\n  once war was declared , darwin began to receive more attention from military planners . in june 1940 , no. 12 squadron was \" cannibalised \" to form two additional units , headquarters raaf station darwin and no. 13 squadron . no. 12 squadron retained its wirraway flight , while its two flights of ansons went to the new squadron ; these were replaced later that month by more capable lockheed hudsons . eaton was appointed co of the base , gaining promotion to temporary group captain in september . his squadrons were employed in escort , maritime reconnaissance , and coastal patrol duties , the overworked aircraft having to be sent to raaf station richmond , new south wales , after every 240 hours flying time — with a consequent three @-@ week loss from darwin \\'s strength — as deep maintenance was not yet possible in the northern territory . soon after the establishment of headquarters raaf station darwin , minister for air james fairbairn visited the base . piloting his own light plane , he was greeted by four wirraways that proceeded to escort him into landing ; the minister subsequently complimented eaton on the \" keen @-@ ness and efficiency of all ranks \" , particularly considering the challenging environment . when fairbairn died in the canberra air disaster shortly afterwards , his pilot was flight lieutenant robert hitchcock , son of bob hitchcock of the kookaburra and also a former member of eaton \\'s no. 21 squadron . \\n  as senior air commander in the region , eaton sat on the darwin defence co @-@ ordination committee . he was occasionally at loggerheads with his naval counterpart , captain e.p. thomas , and also incurred the ire of trade unionists when he used raaf staff to unload ships in port darwin during industrial action ; eaton himself took part in the work , shovelling coal alongside his men . on 25 february 1941 , he made a flight north to reconnoitre timor , ambon , and babo in dutch new guinea for potential use by the raaf in any pacific conflict . by april , the total strength based at raaf station darwin had increased to almost 700 officers and airmen ; by the following month it had been augmented by satellite airfields at bathurst island , groote eylandt , batchelor , and katherine . handing over command of darwin to group captain frederick scherger in october , eaton took charge of no. 2 service flying training school near wagga wagga , new south wales . his \" marked success \" , \" untiring energy \" , and \" tact in handling men \" while in the northern territory were recognised in the new year with his appointment as an officer of the order of the british empire . eaton became co of no. 1 engineering school and its base , raaf station ascot vale , victoria , in april 1942 . twelve months later in townsville , queensland , he formed no. 72 wing , which subsequently deployed to merauke in dutch new guinea , comprising no. 84 squadron ( flying cac boomerang fighters ) , no. 86 squadron ( p @-@ 40 kittyhawk fighters ) , and no. 12 squadron ( a @-@ 31 vengeance dive bombers ) . his relations with north @-@ eastern area command in townsville were strained ; \" mountains were made out of molehills \" in his opinion , and he was reassigned that july to lead no. 2 bombing and gunnery school in port pirie , south australia . \\n  on 30 november 1943 , eaton returned to the northern territory to establish no. 79 wing at batchelor , comprising no. 1 and no. 2 squadrons ( flying bristol beaufort light reconnaissance bombers ) , no. 31 squadron ( bristol beaufighter long @-@ range fighters ) , and no. 18 ( netherlands east indies ) squadron ( b @-@ 25 mitchell medium bombers ) . he developed a good relationship with his dutch personnel , who called him \" oom charles \" ( uncle charles ) . operating under the auspices of north @-@ western area command ( nwa ) , darwin , eaton \\'s forces participated in the new guinea and north @-@ western area campaigns during 1944 , in which he regularly flew on missions himself . through march – april , his beaufighters attacked enemy shipping , while the mitchells and beauforts bombed timor on a daily basis as a prelude to operations reckless and persecution , the invasions of hollandia and aitape . on 19 april , he organised a large raid against su , dutch timor , employing thirty @-@ five mitchells , beauforts and beaufighters to destroy the town \\'s barracks and fuel dumps , the results earning him the personal congratulations of the air officer commanding nwa , air vice marshal \" king \" cole , for his \" splendid effort \" . on the day of the allied landings , 22 april , the mitchells and beaufighters made a daylight raid on dili , portuguese timor . the ground assault met little opposition , credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it . in june – july , no. 79 wing supported the allied attack on noemfoor . eaton was recommended to be mentioned in despatches on 28 october 1944 for his \" gallant and distinguished service \" in nwa ; this was promulgated in the london gazette on 9 march 1945 . \\n  completing his tour with no. 79 wing , eaton was appointed air officer commanding southern area , melbourne , in january 1945 . the german submarine u @-@ 862 operated off southern australia during the first months of 1945 , and the few combat units in eaton \\'s command were heavily engaged in anti @-@ submarine patrols which sought to locate this and any other u @-@ boats in the area . the air officer commanding raaf command , air vice marshal bill bostock , considered the sporadic attacks to be partly \" nuisance value \" , designed to draw allied resources away from the front line of the south west pacific war . in april , eaton complained to bostock that intelligence from british pacific fleet concerning its ships \\' movements eastwards out of western area was hours out of date by the time it was received at southern area command , leading to raaf aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean . there had been no u @-@ boat strikes since february , and by june the naval authorities indicated that there was no pressing need for air cover except for the most important vessels . \\n  = = post @-@ war career and legacy = = \\n  eaton retired from the raaf on 31 december 1945 . in recognition of his war service , he was appointed a commander of the order of orange @-@ nassau with swords by the dutch government on 17 january 1946 . the same month , he became australian consul in dili . he had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area . while based there , he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in allied raids during the war , taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from no. 79 wing . in july 1947 , dutch forces launched a \" police action \" against territory held by the fledgling indonesian republic , which had been declared shortly after the end of the war . following a ceasefire , the united nations set up a commission , chaired by eaton as consul @-@ general , to monitor progress . eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves . his requests to the australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region ; the australians were soon followed by british and us observers , and enabled eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world . the dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of un forces and accused eaton of \" impropriety \" , but the australian government refused to recall him . following the transfer of sovereignty in december 1949 , he became australia \\'s first secretary and chargé d \\'affaires to the republic of the united states of indonesia . in 1950 , he returned to australia to serve with the department of external affairs in canberra . after retiring from public service in 1951 , he and his wife farmed at metung , victoria , and cultivated orchids . they later moved to frankston , where eaton was involved in promotional work . \\n  charles eaton died in frankston on 12 november 1979 . survived by his wife and two sons , he was cremated . in accordance with his wishes , his ashes were scattered near tennant creek , site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the kookaburra , from an raaf caribou on 15 april 1981 . his name figures prominently in the northern territory , commemorated by lake eaton in central australia , eaton place in the darwin suburb of karama , charles eaton drive on the approach to darwin international airport , and the charles moth eaton saloon bar in the tennant creek goldfields hotel . he is also honoured with a display at the northern territory parliament , and a national trust memorial at tennant creek airport . at the raaf \\'s 2003 history conference , air commodore mark lax , recalling eaton \\'s search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions between the wars , commented : \" today , we might think of eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community — a tradition that continues today . perhaps i might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned — the amazing location of missing yachtsmen thierry dubois , isabelle autissier and tony bullimore by our p @-@ 3s that guided the navy to their eventual rescue . my observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected , supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the australian community

east of the city of mumbai in the indian state of maharashtra . the island , located on an arm of the arabian sea , consists of two groups of caves — the first is a large group of five hindu caves , the second , a smaller group of two buddhist caves . the hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures , representing the shaiva hindu sect , dedicated to the lord shiva . \\n  the rock cut architecture of the caves has been dated to between the 5th and 8th centuries , although the identity of the original builders is still a subject of debate . the caves are hewn from solid basalt rock . all the caves were also originally painted in the past , but now only traces remain . \\n  the main cave ( cave 1 , or the great cave ) was a hindu place of worship until portuguese rule began in 1534 , after which the caves suffered severe damage . this cave was renovated in the 1970s after years of neglect , and was designated a unesco world heritage site in 1987 to preserve the artwork . it is currently maintained by the archaeological survey of india ( asi ) . \\n  = = geography = = \\n  elephanta island , or gharapuri , is about 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) east of the apollo bunder ( bunder in marathi means a \" pier for embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and goods \" ) on the mumbai harbour and 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) south of pir pal in trombay . the island covers about 10 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) at high tide and about 16 km2 ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) at low tide . gharapuri is small village on the south side of the island . the elephanta caves can be reached by a ferry from the gateway of india , mumbai , which has the nearest airport and train station . the cave is closed on monday . \\n  the island is 2 @.@ 4 km ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) in length with two hills that rise to a height of about 150 m ( 490 ft ) . a deep ravine cuts through the heart of the island from north to south . on the west , the hill rises gently from the sea and stretches east across the ravine and rises gradually to the extreme east to a height of 173 m ( 568 ft ) . this hill is known as the stupa hill . forest growth with clusters of mango , tamarind , and karanj trees cover the hills with scattered palm trees . rice fields are seen in the valley . the fore shore is made up of sand and mud with mangrove bushes on the fringe . landing quays sit near three small hamlets known as set bunder in the north @-@ west , mora bunder in the northeast , and gharapuri or raj bunder in the south . \\n  the two hills of the island , the western and the eastern , have five rock @-@ cut caves in the western part and a brick stupa on the eastern hill on its top composed of two caves with a few rock @-@ cut cisterns . one of the caves on the eastern hill is unfinished . it is a protected island with a buffer zone according to a notification issued in 1985 , which also includes \" a prohibited area \" that stretches 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) from the shoreline . \\n  = = history = = \\n  since no inscriptions on any of the island have been discovered , the ancient history of the island is conjectural , at best . pandavas , the heroes of the hindu epic mahabharata , and banasura , the demon devotee of shiva , are both credited with building temples or cut caves to live . local tradition holds that the caves are not man @-@ made . \\n  the elephanta caves are \" of unknown date and attribution \" . art historians have dated the caves in the range of late 5th to late 8th century ad . archaeological excavations have unearthed a few kshatrapa coins dated to 4th century ad . the known history is traced only to the defeat of mauryan rulers of konkan by the badami chalukyas emperor pulakesi ii ( 609 – 642 ) in a naval battle , in 635 ad . elephanta was then called puri or purika , and served as the capital of the konkan mauryas . some historians attribute the caves to the konkan mauryas , dating them to the mid @-@ 6th century , though others refute this claim saying a relatively small kingdom like the konkan mauryas could not undertake \" an almost superhuman excavation effort , \" which was needed to carve the rock temples from solid rock and could not have the skilled labor to produce such \" high quality \" sculpture . \\n  some other historians attribute the construction to the kalachuris ( late 5th to 6th century ) , who may have had a feudal relationship with the konkan mauryas . in an era where polytheism was prevalent , the elephanta main cave dedicates the monotheism of the pashupata shaivism sect , a sect to which kalachuris as well as konkan mauryas belonged . \\n  the chalukyas , who defeated the kalachuris as well as the konkan mauryas , are also believed by some to be creators of the main cave , in the mid @-@ 7th century . the rashtrakutas are the last claimants to the creation of the main cave , approximated to the early 7th to late 8th century . the elephanta shiva cave resembles in some aspects the 8th @-@ century rashtrakuta rock @-@ temple kailash at ellora . the trimurti of elephanta showing the three faces of shiva is akin to the trimurti of brahma , vishnu and mahesh ( shiva ) , which was the royal insignia of the rashtrakutas . the nataraja and ardhanarishvara sculptures are also attributed to the rashtrakutas . \\n  later , elephanta was ruled by another chalukyan dynasty , and then by gujarat sultanate , who surrendered it to the portuguese in 1534 . by then , elephanta was called gharapuri , which denotes a hill settlement . the name is still used in the local marathi language . the portuguese named the island \" elephanta island \" in honour of a huge rock @-@ cut black stone statue of an elephant that was then installed on a mound , a short distance east of gharapuri village . the elephant now sits in the jijamata udyaan zoo in mumbai . \\n  portuguese rule saw a decline in the hindu population on the island and the abandonment of the shiva cave ( main cave ) as a regular hindu place of worship , though worship on mahashivratri , the festival of shiva , continued and still does . the portuguese did considerable damage to the sanctuaries . portuguese soldiers used the reliefs of shiva in the main cave for target practice , sparing only the trimurti sculpture . they also removed an inscription related to the creation of the caves . while some historians solely blame the portuguese for the destruction of the caves , others also cite water @-@ logging and dripping rainwater as additional damaging factors . the portuguese left in 1661 as per the marriage treaty of charles ii of england and catherine of braganza , daughter of king john iv of portugal . this marriage shifted possession of the islands to the british empire , as part of catherine \\'s dowry to charles . \\n  though the main cave was restored in the 1970s , other caves , including three consisting of important sculptures , are still badly damaged . the caves were designated a unesco world heritage site in 1987 as per the cultural criteria of unesco : the caves \" represent a masterpiece of human creative genius \" and \" bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared \" . \\n  = = overview = = \\n  the island has two groups of caves in the rock @-@ cut architectural style . the caves are hewn

columns joined together by capitals . the cave entrance is aligned with the north – south axis , unusual for a shiva shrine ( normally east – west ) . the northern entrance to the cave , which has 1 @,@ 000 steep steps , is flanked by two panels of shiva dated to the gupta period . the left panel depicts yogishvara ( the lord of yoga ) and the right shows nataraja ( shiva as the lord of dance ) .

relates to both these panels . once , parvati was annoyed with shiva . at this moment , ravana , who was passing by mount kailash , found it as an obstruction to his movement . upset , ravana shook it vigorously and as a result , parvati got scared and hugged shiva . enraged by ravana \\'s arrogance , shiva stamped down on ravana , who sang praises of shiva to free him of his misery and turned into

heads are said to represent three essential aspects of shiva : creation , protection , and destruction . the right half @-@ face ( west face ) shows him as a young person with sensuous lips , embodying life and its vitality . in his hand he holds an object resembling a rosebud , depicting the promise of life and creativity . this face is closest to that of brahma , the creator or uma or vamadeva , the feminine side of shiva and creator of joy and beauty . the left half @-@ face ( east face ) is that of a moustached young man , displaying anger . this is shiva as the terrifying aghora or bhairava , the one whose anger can engulf the entire world in flames , leaving only ashes behind . this is also known as rudra @-@ shiva , the destroyer . the central face , benign and meditative , resembles the preserver vishnu . this is tatpurusha , \" master of positive and negative principles of existence and preserver of their harmony \" or shiva as the yogi yogeshwar in deep meditation praying for the preservation of humanity . the aspects sadyojata and ishana ( not carved ) faces are considered to be at the back and top of the sculpture . the trimurti sculpture , with the gateway of india in the background , has been adopted as the logo of the maharashtra tourism department ( mtdc ) . \\n  the gangadhara image to the right of the trimurti is an ensemble of divinities assembled around the central figures of shiva and parvati , the former bearing the river ganges as she descends from heaven . the carving is 4 m ( 13 ft ) wide and 5 @.@ 207 m ( 17 @.@ 08 ft ) high . the image

figure ( with broken arms ) , representing the three sacred rivers ganges , yamuna , and sarasvati , is depicted . shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments . the arms hold a coiling serpent whose hood is seen above his left shoulder . another hand ( partly broken ) gives the semblance of shiva hugging parvati , with a head of matted hair . there is a small snake on the right hand and a tortoise close to the neck , with a bundle tied to the back . an ornamented drapery covers his lower torso , below the waist . parvati is carved to the left of shiva with a coiffured hair dress , fully bedecked with ornaments and jewellery , also fully draped , with her right hand touching the head of a female attendant who carries parvati \\'s dress case . the gods brahma and indra , with their mystic regalia and mounts , are shown to the right of shiva ; vishnu , riding his mount garuda , is shown to the left of parvati . many other details are defaced but a kneeling figure in the front is inferred to be the king who ordered the image to be carved . there are many divinities and attendant females at the back . the whole setting is under the sky and cloud scenes , with men and

holding an elephant \\'s skin as a cover ; the elephant \\'s head , carved tusk , and trunk are seen hanging from the left hand . the second left hand depicts a snake coiled round it . the hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain andhaka . furthermore , pieces of a male and two female forms , figures of two ascetics , a small figure in front , a female figure , and two dwarfs

portico is 26 m ( 85 ft ) long and 11 m ( 36 ft ) deep . the chapel is supported by eight eight @-@ cornered columns and two demi @-@ columns and is irregular in shape . at the back of the portico are three chambers ; the central one has an altar and a water channel ( pranalika ) , though the linga is lost . the shrine door has some traces of sculpture ( a boy , a fat figure , alligators on the frieze , and broken animal figures at the head of a doorjamb ) . the door @-@ keepers of the shrine are now in fragments . \\n  a little to the south of the last cave is another cave in worse

tiger sculpture , which was worshipped as the tiger goddess vaghesheri . this sculpture may be a guardian of the north entrance of cave 1 . a linga is also found near a small pond at top of the hill . sculptures depicting a stone with a sun and a moon and a mother suckling a child ( now moved ) were also found nearby . \\n  across the top of the ravine from cave 1 is large hall known as sitabai \\'s temple ( cave ) . the portico has four pillars and two pilasters . the hall has 3 chambers at the back , the central one a shrine and the rest for priests ( both are plain rooms ) . the door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze , with the threshold having lion figures at the end . the shrine has an altar , a water channel , and hole in the centre , in which a statue of parvati may have been worshipped . a 17th @-@ century record states that \" this cave [ has ] a beautiful gate with a porch of exquisitely wrought marble \" and two idols , one of goddess vetal candi and a head being in a large square seat . \\n  passing along the face of the eastern hill to the north of sitabai \\'s cave is a small hindu excavation with a veranda , which was probably to be three cells , but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock . towards the east of hill is a dry pond , with large artificial boulders and buddhist cisterns along its banks . at the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound that resembles a buddhist stupa . \\n  = = preservation = = \\n  the threats to elephanta caves have been identified as the following : developmental pressures ( mainly due to its location within the mumbai harbour ) , anthropogenic pressure due to growth of population of the communities residing on the island , industrial growth of the port facilities close to the island , no risk preparedness plan to address natural calamities such as earthquake , cyclones and terrorist attacks , unsustainable tourism and tourist facilities on the island , and poor management of the heritage monument . \\n  preservation of elephanta island as a whole with its monuments has been ensured both through legislation and by physical restoration of the caves and its sculptures . the basic legislations enacted are : the ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains act of 1958 and rules ( 1959 ) ; the elephanta island ( protected monument ) rules of 1957 , which prohibits mining , quarrying , blasting , excavation and other operations near the monument ; the antiquities and art treasures act promulgated in 1972 with its rules promulgated in 1973 ; a notification issued in 1985 declaring the entire island and a 1 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) area from the shore as \" a prohibited area \" ; a series of maharashtra state government environmental acts protecting the site ; the 1966 regional and town planning act ; and the 1995 heritage regulations for greater bombay . \\n  the archaeological survey of india ( asi ) , aurangabad circle , on the basis of the above legislation and rules , maintain and manage the monuments . the physical measures undertaken for conservation cover include stabilisation of the rock face , construction of supports to the cave structures where pillars have collapsed , and consolidation of cave floors and construction of a parapet wall surrounding the site . in addition , visitor facilities at the site have been upgraded ( such as toilet facilities , railing construction , pathways , and a flight of steps from the jetty to the caves ) . an on @-@ site museum has been established and a conservation plan has been put in place . overall , conservation of the property is stated to be good . the site receives approximately 25 @,@ 000 visitors per month . public information brochures are also available at the venue of the monuments . during the world heritage day on 18 april and world heritage week between 19 and 25 november there are special events held at the caves . another popular event organised is an annual traditional dance festival that attracts many visitors . \\n  after declaring the caves a world heritage site , unesco granted $ 100 @,@ 000 to document the site \\'s history and draw up a site plan . a part of the grant was used for conservation of the caves . based on assessments by unesco , management plans include : better communication and collaboration between the asi , on @-@ site staff , and other responsible government departments ; improved public information and awareness programs ; monitoring environmental impact of tourists on the cave and island environment ; greater attention to the maintenance of the rocks to address water leakages into the caves ; and daily monitoring of both structural and chemical conservation measures . \\n  the indian national trust for art and cultural heritage ( intach ) is also involved with the archaeological survey of india in improving the local conditions at the cave site . a book has been published jointly by unesco , intach and the government of india which presents a comprehensive site plan for restoration and a brief history of each sculpture constructed inside the caves . \\n  = devin townsend = \\n  devin garret townsend ( born may 5 , 1972 ) is a canadian musician , songwriter and record producer . he was the founder , songwriter , vocalist , and guitarist in extreme metal band strapping young lad from 1994 to 2007 and has an extensive career as a solo artist . \\n  after performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school , townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on steve vai \\'s album sex & religion . after recording and touring with vai , townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry , and vented his anger on the solo album heavy as a really heavy thing released under the pseudonym strapping young lad . he soon assembled a band under the name , and released the critically acclaimed city in 1997 . since then , he has released three more studio albums with strapping young lad , along with solo material released under his own independent record label , hevydevy records . \\n  townsend \\'s solo albums , a diverse mix of hard rock , progressive metal , ambient , and new @-@ age , have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians . in 2002 he formed the devin townsend band , a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases . in 2007 , he disbanded both strapping young lad and the devin townsend band , taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family . after a two @-@ year hiatus , he began recording again , and soon announced the formation of the devin townsend project . the project began with a series of four albums , released from 2009 to 2011 , each written in a different style , and townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker . \\n  across all his bands and projects , townsend has released twenty @-@ three studio albums and three live albums . townsend \\'s trademark production style , featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound , has been compared to the styles of phil spector and frank zappa . his versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera @-@ esque singing , and his songwriting is similarly diverse . townsend \\'s musical style is rooted in metal , and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality . \\n  = = biography = = \\n  = = = early musical career ( 1972 – 1994 ) = = = \\n  devin townsend was born in new westminster , british columbia , on may 5 , 1972 . townsend picked up the banjo when he was five , and began playing guitar when he was 12 . as an early teenager he befriended brian \" beav \" waddell , who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project . he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school , and founded grey skies at the age of 19 . around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought , replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud , both of whom would later become members of townsend \\'s flagship band , strapping young lad . in 1993 , townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes , a project he later described as \" just as violent as strapping young lad \" . \\n  townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels . relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album , promise . shortly afterward , the label introduced him to musician steve vai . impressed with townsend \\'s vocal work , vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion . after recording sex and religion , townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album . townsend soon landed a second touring gig , this time with the opening band of vai \\'s tour , the wildhearts . he played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in europe , and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge . ginger , the band \\'s frontman , remained close friends with townsend , later co @-@ writing several songs on infinity and the christeen + 4 demos ep . \\n  while on tour with the wildhearts , townsend formed a short @-@ lived thrash metal project with metallica \\'s then @-@ bassist jason newsted . the band , known as ir8 , featured newsted on vocals and bass , townsend on guitar , and tom hunting of exodus on drums . the group recorded a few songs together , although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that . \" people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd , which is absolutely not true , \" he explains . \" people took this project way too seriously . \" a demo tape was put together , but the material was not released until 2002 , when newsted published the ir8 vs. sexoturica compilation . \\n  though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career , he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry . \" i was becoming a product of somebody else \\'s imagination , and it was mixing with my own personality , \" he later reflected . \" this combination was appalling . \" he pushed to get his own projects off the ground . despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians , however , townsend continued to face rejection of his own music . relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vai \\'s offer , seeing no commercial appeal in townsend \\'s music . \" i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve , \" he mused . while touring with the wildhearts , townsend received a phone call from an a & r representative for roadrunner records , expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him . the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner , who regarded townsend \\'s recordings as \" just noise \" . \\n  = = = heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity ( 1994 – 1998 ) = = = \\n  in 1994 , century media records offered townsend a contract to make \" some extreme albums \" . he agreed to a five @-@ album deal with the record label , and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album millennium and the 1995 album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly . townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad . he avoided using his real name at this point in career , looking for a fresh start after his high @-@ profile vai gig . \" at the beginning , i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasn \\'t the best publicity to have , \" he later explained . \" i was playing somebody else \\'s music and i was judged in respect to that music . \" townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album , heavy as a really heavy thing , which was released in april 1995 . \\n  following the release of the record , townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in 1996 entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics . written and recorded in under a month , the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success . townsend founded his own independent record label , hevydevy records , to release the album . townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city , including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan , along with townsend \\'s former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass . the industrial @-@ influenced album was released in 1997 . to this day , the album is widely considered strapping young lad \\'s best work , with metal maniacs calling it \" groundbreaking \" and revolver naming it \" one of the greatest metal albums of all time \" . townsend himself considers it the band \\'s \" ultimate \" album . later that year , townsend released his second solo album , ocean machine : biomech . the album featured a mix of hard rock , ambient , and progressive rock . \\n  after the completion of city and ocean machine : biomech , townsend began to approach a mental breakdown . \" i started to see human beings as little lonesome , water based , pink meat , \" he explained , \" life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand . \" in 1997 , he checked himself into a mental @-@ health hospital , where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder . the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from ; he felt his disorder \" gave birth to the two extremes that are strapping \\'s city record and ocean machine : biomech . \" after being discharged from the hospital , townsend found that \" everything just clicked \" and he was able to write his third solo album , infinity , which he described as \" the parent project \" of city and ocean machine : biomech , with music influenced by broadway . townsend returned to the studio , accompanied by hoglan , to work on the album , on which townsend played most of the instruments . infinity was released in october 1998 . later in his career , townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record . \\n  with infinity , townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name , dropping the ocean machine moniker , to reduce confusion . he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects , they are all simply aspects of his identity . the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine : biomech , under townsend \\'s name , to reflect the new arrangement . townsend \\'s bandmates began to play two sets at their shows , one as strapping young lad , and one as the devin townsend band , playing songs from townsend \\'s solo albums . \\n  = = = physicist and terria ( 1999 – 2001 ) = = = \\n  townsend \\'s next project took several years to come to fruition . after the creation of the ir8 demo tape , townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist , which they described as \" heavier than strapping young lad \" . when the ir8 tape was leaked , newsted \\'s metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project . hetfield was \" fucking pissed \" that newsted was playing outside the band , and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects . with the project stalled , townsend instead wrote the album himself , entitling it physicist . townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it , the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album . the thrash @-@ influenced physicist was released in june 2000 , and is generally considered a low point in townsend \\'s career . hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed , and townsend considers it his worst album to date . \\n  feeling he had \" ostracized a bunch of fans \" with physicist , townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record . townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band , and looked to write an \" introspective \" album dedicated to his homeland . he produced and recorded terria , a \" highly illustrated stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness \" album , with gene hoglan on drums , craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards . townsend cited ween \\'s white pepper as an inspiration for the album . terria was released in november 2001 . \\n  = = = strapping young lad through synchestra ( 2003 – 2006 ) = = = \\n  townsend \\'s solo run lasted until 2002 . after a five @-@ year break from recording , strapping young lad reunited to record a new album . townsend credits the album , strapping young lad , as an emotional response to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , in the united states . \" if the world \\'s about to blow up , \" said townsend , \" let \\'s write the soundtrack for it . \" the album \\'s lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the \" hostile \" lyrics of city . musically , strapping young lad was less industrial than city , and more reminiscent of death metal , with a \" larger @-@ than @-@ life \" rock production style . townsend cited front line assembly , grotus , and samael \\'s passage as influences . the self @-@ titled album was released in february 2003 . it received lukewarm reviews , with critics finding it inferior to city , but it was the band \\'s first charting album , entering at 97th place on billboard \\'s top heatseekers chart . \\n  while strapping young lad was being reunited , townsend formed a new , permanent band \" on par with strapping \" to record and tour for his solo releases . the devin townsend band consisted of brian \" beav \" waddell on guitar , mike young on bass , ryan van poederooyen on drums , and dave young on keyboards . townsend performed guitar , vocals , and production , as he did in strapping young lad . townsend worked on the band \\'s first album , accelerated evolution , at the same time he was working on strapping young lad , spending half the week on one and half on the other . accelerated evolution , named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year , was released a month after strapping young lad . mike g. of metal maniacs called it \" the album of the year \" , praising it for \" the hard @-@ to @-@ accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible , simultaneously heavy \\' n \\' rockin \\' yet majestic and beautiful . \" prior to the formation of the devin townsend band , townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup ; the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs . after the release of accelerated evolution , townsend \\'s two bands toured separately for their separate albums . \\n  strapping young lad began working on their next album , alien , in march 2004 . feeling that the band \\'s previous album did not live up to expectations , townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme . to prepare for the new album , townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder . \" i think that as an artist , in order for me to get to the next plateau , i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy , \" he explains . \" and alien was no exception with that . \" although townsend considered the album an \" impenetrable mass of technicality \" , it was well received on its release , selling 3 @,@ 697 copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts . around this time , townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout : brotherhood of steel . \\n  shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record , with the working title human . townsend intended the album as the more \" pleasant \" counterpart to alien . \" it \\'s basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while . \" the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january 2006 . townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra , blending his trademark \" pop metal \" with influences from folk , polka , and middle eastern music . the final strapping young lad album , the new black , was released later in 2006 . \\n  = = = ziltoid the omniscient and hiatus ( 2006 – 2008 ) = = = \\n  townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family . from home , townsend completed his second solo ambient album , the hummer , releasing it exclusively on his website in november 2006 . \\n  in may 2007 , townsend released ziltoid the omniscient , a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien . this was truly a solo album ; he programmed the drums using drumkit from hell , a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by tomas haake of meshuggah and played all other instruments himself . shortly after the album \\'s release , townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with strapping young lad or the devin townsend band . he explained that he was \" burnt out on travelling , touring , and self promotion \" and wished to do production work , write albums , and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring . \\n  in 2008 , townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the adult swim cartoon metalocalypse ( see musician cameos in metalocalypse for more ) . the original character design for pickles the drummer , one of the series \\' main characters , bore a striking resemblance to townsend . the series \\' co @-@ creator brendon small acknowledged the similarity , and altered the design before the series began . \" we made sure he didn \\'t look like devin townsend . we gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn \\'t look like that . \" \\n  = = = devin townsend project ( 2008 – 2012 ) = = = \\n  after removing himself from the music industry , townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking . townsend found it \" disconcerting \" that he had difficulty writing music without drugs , and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician . he spent a year producing albums in absence of writing , but found it unrewarding and decided to \" pick up the guitar and just write \" . this began a period of \" self discovery \" where he learned \" how to create without drugs \" . \\n  over two years , townsend wrote over 60 songs , and found that they fit into \" four distinct styles \" . in march 2009 , townsend announced his plans for a four @-@ album series called devin townsend project , with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being \" accountable \" for the persona he projects to the public . the project \\'s concept includes a different \" theme \" and a different group of musicians on each album . \\n  ki , the first album of the devin townsend project tetralogy was written to \" set the stage \" for the subsequent albums . townsend channelled his new @-@ found control and sobriety into ki , a \" tense , quiet \" album , which contrasts with much of the music he had been known for . additional female vocals were provided by ché aimee dorval ( casualties of cool ) . ki was released in may 2009 . \\n  the second entry , a \" commercial , yet heavy \" album called addicted , was released in november 2009 and features lead vocals from townsend and dutch singer anneke van giersbergen . brian \" beav \" waddell was recruited from the devin townsend band to play bass . \\n  townsend returned to the stage in january 2010 , touring north america with headliner between the buried and me as well as cynic and scale the summit . this was followed by a headlining tour in australia and a series of high @-@ profile shows in europe ( for example co @-@ headlining the brutal assault festival in czech republic ) . he headlined a north american tour with uk label mates tesseract supporting , which began in october 2010 , and toured in europe with support from aeon zen and anneke van giersbergen . \\n  the third and fourth albums in the devin townsend project series , deconstruction and ghost , were released simultaneously on june 21 , 2011 . in december 2011 all four devin townsend project albums with additional material were released as the contain us box set . townsend performed all four of devin townsend project albums in london and recorded them for a dvd box set called by a thread : live in london 2011 that was released on june 18 , 2012 . the first three shows were held at the university of london union , november 10 – 12 , 2011 . ki , addicted , and deconstruction were each performed on one night , respectively . the show for ghost was held at the union chapel , islington on november 13 , 2011 . these four shows were each entitled \" an evening with the devin townsend project \" . \\n  despite the devin townsend project being originally a four @-@ album series , townsend decided to continue working under the moniker and released the fifth album , epicloud on september 18 , 2012 . again featuring anneke van giersbergen on vocals , epicloud appeared on several european charts , peaking at number 8 in finland . on october 27 , 2012 , devin townsend performed a one @-@ off show covering his musical career called the retinal circus at roundhouse in london . the 3 @-@ hour performance was recorded in high definition and released on dvd and blu @-@ ray on september 30 , 2013 . also in 2012 , townsend played bass on the debut bent sea album noistalgia . he also produced the record . \\n  another project townsend has mentioned several times between 2009 and 2012 is obviouser , an album featuring \" creepy , bass driven apocalyptic music \" created with an \" ampeg rig \" and an \" icelandic choir \" . working with many projects simultaneously at that time , townsend stated in 2012 the obviouser project is vying for pole position until \" he wakes up and says \\' he wants to do it \\' \" . \\n  = = = casualties of cool and z2 ( 2012 – present ) = = = \\n  after deconstruction and ghost , townsend announced a new album , casualties of cool , with which he started to work after the release of epicloud . the album features ché aimee dorval ( from ki ) on vocals and morgan ågren on drums . townsend described the album sounds like \" haunted johnny cash songs \" and \" late night music \" , highlighting it will be different than anything he has done before . townsend referred the music of the album to be \" closest to his heart \" at this point of his life , and that it is an important and satisfying project he doesn \\'t want to rush . \\n  the album was completed on november 2013 , and a bonus disc was also made for the album , containing the leftover material from the main album as well as songs from ghost 2 , the unreleased compilation of leftover tracks from ghost . originally in 2012 , townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the devin townsend project series , but he ultimately confirmed that casualties of cool is its own project . townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through pledgemusic to support the release of the album . the funding quickly reached its goal , and all additional funds were put directly to townsend \\'s upcoming projects . casualties of cool was released on may 14 , 2014 . the album was re @-@ issued worldwide on january 15 , 2016 containing an additional dvd with live footage from the 2014 concert at the union chapel in london . \\n  from 2009 , townsend worked on a long @-@ running album project called z ² , a sequel to the album ziltoid the omniscient ( 2007 ) . originally in 2012 , he teased he \" may have just written the heaviest thing he \\'s ever done \" for the album , and told there might a surprising lack of ziltoid himself appearing on the album . however , in august 2013 , a london @-@ based radio station teamrock radio aired the first episode of ziltoid radio , a satirical radio show hosted solely by ziltoid , this being one element of the z ² project . townsend also discussed a \" ztv \" or \" ziltoid tv \" is preceding the album . later townsend stated he has found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing , stating \" it takes a lot of effort \" to keep the content with tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek humour entertaining . \\n  after writing ideas for over 70 songs , townsend stated he is finally going to finish the whole project , followed by the announcement the album will be released on october 27 , 2014 . the recording process started in may 2014 , and the final project includes the album , a ziltoid tv program and a live show , with a \" big graphic novel comic \" and a documentary . the album itself is a double album , with disc one being the main album and disc two featuring devin townsend project material ; according to townsend , the album \\'s theme is \" ziltoid against the world \" . the devin townsend project disc is called sky blue and the ziltoid disc is called dark matters . \\n  after finishing the album , townsend stated the project was \" punishing \" and an \" absolute nightmare to complete \" due to amount of material against tight schedules . he also described the hardship of the project by telling \" if he was ever going to start drinking [ again ] , the last months would have been it \" , but now \" he \\'s starting to get excited again \" . later , \" after the chaos of finishing it had subsided \" , townsend stated he is really satisfied with the result . \\n  townsend recently discussed at least a year @-@ long hiatus , beginning after the z ² show taking place at the royal albert hall on april 13 , 2015 . during the indefinitely long break townsend intends to \" recharge his batteries \" , \" get some inspiration and experiences \" and to \" see what the next chapter holds \" for him . \\n  in 2014 , devin recorded a \\' poppy sounding \\' song in los angeles with producer brian howes , but has decided against releasing . devin mentioned he is against the project being contrived due to the current hard rock undertones in popular music . he described it as a \" lukewarm heavy metal devin song \" . on december 11 , 2015 townsend announced via twitter that he was recording vocals for a song by steve vai . \\n  as of april 2016 , devin is in the middle of recording the seventh dtp album , entitled transcendence at armoury studios in vancouver . \\n  = = personal life = = \\n  townsend has been

diverse mix of extreme metal genres : death metal , thrash metal , black metal and industrial metal . townsend \\'s solo material blends many genres and influences , with elements of atmospheric ambient music , hard rock and progressive rock , along with pop metal and arena rock . he described it as \" a highly orchestrated type of expansive music based in hard rock and heavy metal . dense and produced with a large amount of ambient elements . \" despite strapping young lad \\'s greater mainstream acceptance , townsend identifies more with his solo material , and has never intended strapping young lad to be the focus of his music . \\n  = = = production style = = = \\n  as a self @-@ proclaimed \" fan of multitracking \" , townsend has developed a trademark production style

and overall aural pyrotechnics \" , according to mike g. of metal maniacs . townsend mainly uses pro tools to produce his music , alongside other software suites such as steinberg cubase , ableton live , and logic pro . townsend \\'s musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to phil spector and frank zappa . townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo

zagrebačka sinagoga ) was the main place of worship for the jewish community of zagreb in modern @-@ day croatia . it was constructed in 1867 in the kingdom of croatia @-@ slavonia within the austrian empire , and was used until it was demolished by the fascist authorities in 1941 in the axis @-@ aligned independent state of croatia . \\n  the moorish revival synagogue , designed after the leopoldstädter tempel in vienna , was located on modern @-@ day praška street . it has been the only purpose @-@ built jewish house of worship in the history of the city . it was one of the city \\'s most prominent public buildings , as well as one of the most esteemed examples of synagogue architecture in the region . \\n  since the 1980s , plans have been made to rebuild the synagogue in its original location . due to various political circumstances , very limited progress has been made . major disagreements exist between the government and jewish organizations as to how much the latter should be involved in decisions about the reconstruction project , including proposed design and character of the new building . \\n  = = history = = \\n  encouraged by the 1782 edict of tolerance of emperor joseph ii , jews first permanently settled in zagreb in the late eighteenth century , and founded the jewish community in 1806 . in 1809 the jewish community had a rabbi , and by 1811 it had its own cemetery . as early as 1833 , the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue , but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time . \\n  by 1855 , the community had grown to 700 members and , on october 30 of that year , the decision was made to build a new jewish synagogue . the construction committee , appointed in 1861 , selected and purchased a parcel of land at the corner of maria valeria street ( now praška street ) and ban jelačić square , the central town square . however , a new urban planning scheme of 1864 reduced the area available for construction , and the community decided to buy another parcel of 1 @,@ 540 square metres ( 16 @,@ 600 sq ft ) in maria valeria street , approximately 80 metres ( 260 ft ) south of the original location . \\n  = = = design and construction = = = \\n  franjo klein , a vienna @-@ born zagreb architect , was commissioned to build the synagogue . klein , a representative of romantic historicism , modeled the building on the viennese leopoldstädter tempel ( 1858 ) , a moorish revival temple designed by ludwig förster . it became a prototype for synagogue design in central europe . zagreb synagogue used the already developed round arch style ( rundbogenstil ) , but did not adopt förster \\'s early oriental motifs . \\n  the composition of the main facade , with its dominant drawn @-@ out and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts , reflects the internal division into three naves . at ground @-@ floor level , the front was distinguished by the three @-@ arch entrance and bifora , whereas the first @-@ floor level had a high triforium with an elevated arch and the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases . \\n  the synagogue occupied the greater part of the plot , facing west . it receded from the street regulation @-@ line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in austria – hungary , prohibiting non @-@ catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street . the synagogue had a wider and slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves ; unlike förster \\'s synagogue in vienna , it did not have a basilical plan . \\n  construction began in 1866 and was completed the following year . the synagogue was officially consecrated on september 27 , 1867 , a ceremony attended by representatives of city and regional authorities , zagreb public figures , and many citizens . it was the first prominent public building in zagreb \\'s lower town , and its architecture and scale aroused general admiration and praise . \\n  = = = 19th and early 20th century = = = \\n  with the new synagogue , an organ was introduced into religious service . the small minority of orthodox jews found this change to be intolerable , and they began to hold their services separately , in rented rooms . \\n  in the 1880 earthquake , the synagogue suffered minor damage and was repaired the following year . \\n  largely due to immigration from hungary , bohemia and moravia , the jewish population of zagreb quickly grew in size : from 1 @,@ 285 members in 1887 to 3 @,@ 237 members in 1900 , and then to 5 @,@ 970 members in 1921 . the synagogue became too small to accommodate the needs of the ever @-@ growing community . in 1921 a renovation was undertaken to increase the number of available seats . a 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned . a central heating system was installed in 1933 . \\n  = = = demolition during world war ii = = = \\n  during the 1941 collapse of the kingdom of yugoslavia under the axis invasion in the april war , the independent state of croatia was created . it was ruled by the extreme nationalist ustaša regime . the ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the jews , modeled after the nazi germany approach , and at times even more brutal . racial laws were introduced , jewish property was confiscated , and the jews were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in croatia and abroad . \\n  in october 1941 , the newly installed mayor of zagreb , ivan werner , issued a decree ordering the demolition of the praška street synagogue , ostensibly because it did not fit into the city \\'s master plan . the demolition began on october 10 , 1941 , proceeding slowly so as not to damage the adjacent buildings ; it was finished by april 1942 . the whole process was photographed for propaganda purposes , and the photographs were shown to the public at an antisemitic exhibition first held in zagreb . it was also shown in dubrovnik , karlovac , sarajevo , vukovar and zemun , as an illustration of the \" solution of the jewish question in croatia \" . \\n  a fragment of the film footage of the demolition was discovered five decades later by the film director lordan zafranović during research for his 1993 documentary feature , decline of the century : testimony of l. z. ; 41 seconds of the film survives . this footage was also shown in mira wolf \\'s documentary , the zagreb synagogue 1867 @-@ 1942 ( 1996 ) , produced by croatian radiotelevision . \\n  the synagogue \\'s eight valuable torah scrolls were saved due to an intervention by leonardo grivičić , an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from mile budak , a minister in the ustaša government . he was also close to poglavnik ante pavelić and the third reich \\'s ambassador to croatia , edmund glaise @-@ horstenau . although grivičić did not have a significant political role in the independent state of croatia , he was considered trustworthy . on october 9 , 1941 , he learned about the regime \\'s plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning . by that evening , grivičić secretly relayed the information to the synagogue \\'s chief cantor , grüner , and during the night , the torah scrolls were moved to safety . \\n  shortly after the destruction of the synagogue , the catholic archbishop of zagreb aloysius stepinac delivered a homily in which he said : \" a house of god of any faith is a holy thing , and whoever harms it will pay with their lives . in this world and the next they will be punished . \" . \\n  the only surviving fragments of the building — the wash @-@ basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt , as well as some parts of a column — were saved by ivo kraus . he pulled them from the rubble shortly after the end of world war ii . the wash @-@ basin and the memorial tables are now in the zagreb city museum . the column fragments are kept by the jewish community of zagreb . \\n  = = reconstruction efforts = = \\n  = = = 1945 – 1990 = = = \\n  only one in five croatian jews survived the holocaust of world war ii . between 1948 and 1952 , nearly one half of the surviving members of jewish community of zagreb opted for emigration to israel , and the community dropped to one @-@ tenth of its pre @-@ war membership . the yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the jewish community of zagreb , including the plot in praška street . all this , combined with the new regime \\'s general hostility toward religion , made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible . \\n  after world war ii , the vacant site of the former synagogue was used as a makeshift volleyball court . the volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building , constructed in 1959 . the department store was completely destroyed in a fire on december 31 , 1980 , and was subsequently dismantled . despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot , and a 1977 architecture competition for its design , no construction took place . instead , the parcel was turned into a parking lot , which it remains to this day . \\n  after 1986 , the jewish community of zagreb began to consider a jewish cultural center and a memorial synagogue . two architects , branko silađin and boris morsan , both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition , came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new jewish center in praška street . silađin \\'s vision was ultimately not accepted by the jewish community ; instead , plans were being made for the construction of the cultural center and a synagogue , following an international architecture competition . however , despite support for the project both within yugoslavia and abroad , the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government . the project was not developed . \\n  = = = 1990 – present = = = \\n  by the autumn of 1990 , after the first democratic elections in croatia , the municipal government finally approved the project . an architectural competition was planned for january 1991 . political turmoil in the country , followed by the breakup of yugoslavia and the croatian war of independence ( 1991 – 1995 ) , caused the project to be put on hold again . in 1994 president of croatia franjo tuđman said to jakov bienenfeld , council member of the zagreb jewish community , that they should build the new synagogue at the site of the former synagogue , which will be funded by the croatian government . bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when 1800 catholic churches are left destroyed at the time , during croatian war of independence . \\n  in the meantime , the jewish community of zagreb sought to legally reacquire its property . the croatian denationalization law was enacted in 1996 , and the praška street parcel was finally returned to the community on december 31 , 1999 . by 2000 , reconstruction activities were invigorated again . an investment study was submitted to the government of croatia and the city of zagreb in july 2004 and revised in october 2004 . the architecture competition was planned for 2005 . however , a 2005 rift in the jewish community of zagreb resulted in formation of a splinter jewish community , bet israel , led by ivo and slavko goldstein . \\n  in september 2006 , the government of croatia formed a construction workgroup . it was decided that the project , estimated at the time at hrk 173 million ( us $ 30 million ) , would be partially financed by the government of croatia and the city of zagreb , and that both jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup . however , the involvement of bet israel was deemed unacceptable by the jewish community of zagreb , which is the sole owner of the praška street property , and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the zagreb jewish community . as a consequence , the community and its president , ognjen kraus , refused further participation in the project under the set conditions . \\n  further disagreements existed about the design and character of the new building . facsimile reconstruction , while feasible , was not seriously contemplated . there was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose . while the jewish community of zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue , the bet israel advocated building a replica of the original synagogue \\'s facade , perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism . opinions of architects , urban planners , and art historians were also divided along similar lines . \\n  in 2014 and 2015 , the jewish community of zagreb presented new plans for a 10 @,@ 600 m2 ( 114 @,@ 000 sq ft ) multi @-@ purpose jewish center and synagogue in praška street . \\n  = 1806 great coastal hurricane = \\n  the 1806 great coastal hurricane was a severe and damaging storm along the east coast of the

however , approximately 150 mi ( 240 km ) east of the bahamian island of eleuthera . steering currents brought the storm northward , and it approached charleston , south carolina on 22 august , where a generally easterly flow preceded the storm indicated its passage far east of the city . the hurricane made landfall at the mouth of the cape fear river in north carolina later that day , though the earliest impacts from the storm started several days earlier , with gusts initially toward the northeast but later curving southwestward . reports of similar wind shifts throughout the region

lighthouse on north island flanking winyah bay collapsed under high winds , and in georgetown proper , the hurricane was considered to be the worst since the 1804 antigua – charleston hurricane , despite its storm surge being of a lesser size . a cotton field covering 94 acres was ruined nearby . at smithville , north carolina , numerous ships experienced damage , while considerable destruction to structures was observed , with many wharves wrecked . meanwhile , at wilmington , the hurricane inflicted widespread damage , with many wharves severely damaged , and significant losses sustained by salt , sugar , rice , and lumber industries . the gable sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water , and wooden houses suffered especially badly , with many obliterated and those under construction flattened . one individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed , one by drowning , at local plantations . at bald head island , the united states revenue cutter service vessel governor williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey . a second boat owned by the agency , the diligence , was tethered at port in wilmington and endured no damage ; similarly , little impact occurred at new bern . throughout the storm , several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the north carolinan coast . on the bogue banks , the remains of the adolphus and atlantic were discovered , and at the core banks , a dead body was washed ashore , partially eaten by fish . \\n  moderate damage occurred upon the hurricane \\'s arrival in norfolk , virginia . winds toppled a number of newly built structures and chimneys , uprooted trees and fences , and washed two watercraft aground . after the storm , alterations to the shoreline around the chesapeake bay permitted the full establishment of a town at willoughby spit . the rose @-@ in

intelligence teams ( fits ) are two or more police officers who are deployed by uk police forces to gather intelligence on the ground and in some circumstances , to disrupt activists and deter anti

surveillance , but in 2009 the court of appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis . any retained information is recorded on the crimint database . \\n  political activists have criticised fits and said that they feel the aim of fit deployment during protests is to prevent legal protests . journalists have also complained that fits attempt to stop them photographing protests and that they conduct surveillance of journalists . a campaign group , fitwatch , formed in 2007 that aim to obstruct fits and conduct sousveillance on the officers . two members of the group were arrested at the 2008 climate camp on obstruction charges . a similar police surveillance unit , the video intelligence unit is operated by greater manchester police . in june 2010 , the home office announced it would review the use of fits during public order policing . \\n  = = history and purpose = = \\n  fits were first formed in the early 1990s , as part of the public order intelligence unit ( co11 ) , a section of the public order branch of the metropolitan police . they initially targeted football fans , hunt saboteurs and political protesters ( since at least 1996 ) , using cameras , camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public . the police officers wear full uniform , and are intended to be a highly visible presence . their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue . civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside fits . according to scotland yard , the aim of fit teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest . \\n  more recently the teams \\' purpose has been extended to routine police work on low @-@ level crime and anti @-@ social behaviour and police forces throughout the uk now have their own fits . despite the implication in their name that their function is to merely gather intelligence , they are also intended to have a deterrent effect . this approach has been reported to work in reducing reports of anti @-@ social behaviour at times when fits are deployed in specific neighbourhoods . jacqui smith , then home secretary praised operation leopard that used fits to target youths , in laindon , essex stating : \\n  \" operation leopard is exactly the sort of intensive policing that can bring persistent offenders to their senses ... relentless filming of them and their associates throughout the day and night \" \\n  linda catt , an activist , has suggested that their tactics are \" designed to intimidate people and prevent lawful dissent \" . this view is echoed by a police debriefing of their operations at the 2008 camp for climate action which praised fits at the event for disrupting activists . \\n  in june 2010 , the home office announced it would review the use of fits during public order policing . the move was influenced by the discovery that information collected by fits , included that which was unrelated to suspected crimes , for example recording who made speeches at demonstrations . \\n  in october 2010 , fit officers in plain clothes were spotted by a press photographer at a protest against companies avoiding tax , despite commander bob broadhurst telling a parliamentary committee in may 2009 , that only uniformed officers distinguishable by their blue and yellow jackets were involved in gathering intelligence at protests . the metropolitan police told the guardian that it was necessary to deploy plain @-@ clothed officers to \" gather information to provide us with a relevant and up @-@ to @-@ date intelligence picture of what to expect \" . it was the first time that fits are known to have been deployed in plain clothes . \\n  = = legal issues = = \\n  liberty brought a judicial review of the overt surveillance practices in may 2008 , which was decided in favour of the police , however the police were asked to clarify their evidence to the court of appeal , following an investigation by the guardian newspaper . \\n  in may 2009 , the court of appeal ruled that photographs collected by fits of people who have not committed a criminal offence can no longer be kept . the ruling was made after andrew wood , an arms trade activist , was photographed after challenging the management of reed elsevier at their agm over them organising arms trade exhibitions . wood argued that police had harassed him and infringed his right to privacy by photographing him . lord collins of mapesbury said that the police presence had a \" chilling effect \" on people who were protesting lawfully . fits have not been banned but they must now justify the retention of photographs on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis . as a result of the ruling the metropolitan police \\'s public order unit , co11 was forced to delete 40 % of the photos of protesters that it held . \\n  in a report about the policing of the 2009 g @-@ 20 london summit protests , denis o \\'connor , the chief inspector of constabulary , stated that the routine use of fits at protests \" raises fundamental privacy issues and should be reviewed \" . he also said that there was \" confusion \" over the role of fits and advised that the home office should issue guidance over the legality of the surveillance of protesters and the retention of images . \\n  = = information processing = = \\n  the information that fits collect is stored on the crimint database , which is used daily by police

and had their legs bound with straps . they were then placed in restraint positions , arrested , charged and held in custody for four days , including three days in hmp bronzefield , before they were released on bail . the police later retracted all the charges against the women . the women lodged a complaint with the ipcc over the incident . the journalist george monbiot commented on this case , saying that \" the police are turning activism into a crime \" and that \" the fits \\' methods appear to have been lifted from a stasi training manual \" . he claimed that \" anybody who is politically active is filmed , identified , monitored , logged , and cross @-@ checked \" . a police debrief into the operation at kingsnorth praised the deployment of fits saying that they were \" highly effective and gained good intelligence and disruption \" . \\n  three members of fitwatch were convicted for obstructing fit officers in june 2008 as they attempted to photograph those attending a no borders meeting in london . in july 2010 the inner london crown court overturned the men \\'s convictions , with the judge stating that the protesters \\' human rights may have been violated by the fit officers . \\n  on 15 november 2010 , the hosts of the fitwatch blog were asked by the police national e @-@ crime unit to take down the website due to it \" being used to undertake criminal activities \" . the request came after a post on the blog after the 2010 student protest in london , which advised students of actions they should take if they were concerned that they were photographed at the demonstration , such as cutting their hair and disposing of clothing they were wearing . emily apple , one of the founders of the site told the guardian , \" nothing in that post [ giving guidance to student protesters ] has not been said before on our blog or on other sites \" . on 17 november 2010 , the fitwatch website returned , hosted on a web server outside of the uk . \\n  the national union of journalists ( nuj ) has criticised fits for their surveillance and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists . marc vallee , who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest , has said that the teams limit freedom of the press and called on the home office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists . bob broadhurst , who is in charge of public order policing at the metropolitan police , said in a statement to the nuj in 2008 that journalists , \" on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work \" . the nuj are to make a formal complaint to the information commissioner due to the metropolitan police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the freedom of information act . bob broadhurst told photographers at an nuj conference that he had no faith in the national press card ( a form of press pass ) despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona @-@ fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued . \\n  the bbc tv series panorama produced an episode entitled what ever happened to people power ? in july 2009 which discussed the use of fits in targeting activists and journalists . \\n  = = similar police units = = \\n  greater manchester police operate a video intelligence unit , whose plainclothes officers confront and video certain freed prisoners as they leave prison after serving their sentences . they also record footage of people involved in anti @-@ social behaviour on the streets . the aim is to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance of people who have broken the law . video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on tv screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork . footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto youtube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended . this has resulted in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions . since the unit was launched in 2006 more than 900 people have been filmed by the unit . not all of these people are suspects in crime however , people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or if they have been stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances . kieran walsh , a civil liberties lawyer , said the unit \\'s work \" could have implications \" for the force under article 8 of the european convention on human rights - the right to privacy . he believes that filming must be a \" proportionate and reasonable \" response to a crime and that this does not appear to be the case as people are being targeted over what they might do in the future . it is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but gmp currently anticipate it will be stored for 5 years . \\n  = trinsey v. pennsylvania = \\n  trinsey v. pennsylvania 941 f.2d 224 was a case decided by the united states court of appeals for the third circuit that confirmed the validity of special elections held without a primary under the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments to the united states constitution . the case came about due to the death of h. john heinz iii , one of the us senators from pennsylvania , in a plane crash on april 4 , 1991 . under the seventeenth amendment , state legislatures may give the governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant senate seats until a special election can be held , and pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election . instead , both the democrats and republicans would each internally select their candidates . john s. trinsey jr . , a voter and potential candidate , asked the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments , because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties . \\n  after deciding that the statute \\'s subject matter necessitated the strict scrutiny approach , the district court decided on june 10 , 1991 that it was an unconstitutional violation of the right to vote for and select senate candidates . this decision was appealed to the court of appeals for the third circuit , who decided against the use of the strict scrutiny approach and , in its absence , ruled that the statute was not a violation of the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments . academics have been critical of both the decision reached and the approach used , with one suggesting that the \" substantial state interests \" test used in valenti v. rockefeller would be more appropriate . \\n  = = background = = \\n  on april 4 , 1991 h. john heinz iii , one of the us senators from pennsylvania , was killed when his chartered plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear . under the seventeenth amendment to the united states constitution , the legislature of each state has the power to permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held . in pennsylvania , this power had been delegated , and governor robert p. casey signed a writ on may 13 , 1991 , declaring november 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing harris wofford to fill heinz \\'s now @-@ vacant seat . under pennsylvanian law , there was no need for a primary in such a situation ; instead , both the democrats and republicans would each internally select their candidate , who would run in the special election . john s. trinsey jr . , a member of the pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate , challenged the constitutionality of this law , claiming that it violated his rights under the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments . \\n  trinsey argued that , by failing to allow for primaries , the state legislation prevented him from getting to select a candidate of his choice , and that this violated the fourteenth amendment ; the terms of the statute ( and absence of a requirement for primaries ) also allegedly infringed the rights of the electorate under the seventeenth amendment , which required the selection of senators by popular vote ; trinsey \\'s complaint was that the legislation had effectively delegated the power to choose candidates to political parties rather than the electorate . accordingly , trinsey filed a motion for a declaratory judgment to state that the statute was unconstitutional , and also requested that wofford be removed from his seat . counsel for the commonwealth of pennsylvania , joined by the office of the governor , argued that the constitution did not require the holding of primary elections to fill vacancies , and that the statute \" protected valid and compelling state interests in protecting the validity of the electoral process and limiting the term of a [ governor- ] appointed senator \" . \\n  = = judgment = = \\n  the case was first heard in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania , where , following oral arguments , the judge dismissed both trinsey \\'s motion to remove wofford and the commonwealth \\'s motion to dismiss . on june 10 , 1991 , however , the district court declared the statute unconstitutional , stating that it violated both the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments due to the failure to ensure \" popular participation \" through the use of primary elections . this decision was reached following an analysis of the legislative history of the seventeenth amendment and electoral processes ; based on this analysis , the court concluded that the pennsylvanian use of a nomination process before a special election implied a right to vote , which was violated by the lack of a primary and necessitated a strict scrutinising of the legislation . after considering the evidence , the court concluded that \" the interests the commonwealth put forth in support of the statute could not outweigh the infringement of the right to vote \" , leading to the conclusion that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional . \\n  with this \" the public , press and political parties quickly turned their attention to the case \" , with the republican state committee of pennsylvania ( supported by their democratic counterparts ) and several prominent politicians intervening . they moved to expedite an appeal to the court of appeals for the third circuit . in a unanimous opinion , the court of appeals ( consisting of sloviter , greenberg and seitz ) confirmed that there was no restriction of any fundamental right , and therefore that the strict scrutiny process did not need to be applied . in the absence of this process , they held that the seventeenth amendment did not require primary elections to fill vacancies , and more broadly gave state legislatures wide discretion as to how to hold elections ; as such , the statute did not violate the constitution . in december 1991 the supreme court denied a writ of certiorari , presumably because the special election had already taken place in november and the issue was thus moot . \\n  = = significance = = \\n  laura e. little , writing in the temple law review , notes the dearth of guidance for either the district court or court of appeals in trinsey , with no \" explicit direction and no direct precedent \" from either the constitutional provisions or prior case law to rely on . in the absence of guidance , the court of appeals took a narrow view of the issues , something she criticises . under pennsylvanian law , primaries are mandatory in all other elections , and in her opinion the lack of a primary in this case should have been judged to be a violation of trinsey \\'s fundamental rights . combined with the purpose of the seventeenth amendment - to ensure direct election - this should have led to the application of the strict scrutiny test , and the decision that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional . kevin m. gold instead suggests that the test used in valenti v. rockefeller , an analogous decision over the validity of new york state electoral law . in valenti , the judiciary applied the \" substantial state interests \" test , which involves simply looking at whether the statute in question furthers the interests of the states , who under the seventeenth amendment are given some discretion as to the electoral process they use . \\n  = michael jordan = \\n  michael jeffrey jordan ( born february 17 , 1963 ) , also known by his initials , mj , is an american retired professional basketball

after winning the naismith and the wooden college player of the year awards in 1984 , jordan left north carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 nba draft . the chicago bulls selected jordan with the third overall pick , after hakeem olajuwon ( houston rockets ) and sam bowie ( portland trail blazers ) . one of the primary reasons why jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center . however , the trail blazers general manager stu inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center , but more a matter of taking sam bowie over jordan , in part because portland already had a guard with similar skills to jordan , clyde drexler . espn , citing bowie \\'s injury @-@ laden college career , named the blazers \\'

his rookie season . controversy arose before the all @-@ star game when word surfaced that several veteran players , led by isiah thomas , were upset by the amount of attention jordan was receiving . this led to a so @-@ called \" freeze @-@ out \" on jordan , where players refused to pass him the ball throughout the game . the controversy left jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to

 jordan \\'s second season was cut short by a broken foot in the third game of the season , which caused him to miss 64 games . despite jordan \\'s injury and a 30 – 52 record ( at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in nba history ) , the bulls made the playoffs . jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return . against a 1985 – 86 boston celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in nba history , jordan set the still @-@ unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in game 2 . the

history to face magic johnson and james worthy and beat the los angeles lakers four games to one , compiling an outstanding 15 – 2 playoff record along the way . perhaps the best known moment of the

contests . his competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash @-@ talk and well @-@ known work ethic . as the bulls organization built the franchise around jordan , management had to trade away players who were not \" tough enough \" to compete with him in practice . to help improve his defense , he spent extra hours studying film of opponents . on offense , he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time . noted as a durable player , jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986 – 87 to 2001 – 02 , when he injured his right knee . he played all 82 games nine times . jordan has frequently cited david thompson , walter davis , and jerry west as influences . from the start of his career , jordan was unique among nba players in that he had a special \" love of the game clause \" written into his contract , which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time , anywhere . \\n  jordan had a versatile offensive game . he was capable of aggressively driving to the basket , as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate ; his 8 @,@ 772 free throw attempts are the ninth @-@ highest total of all time . as his career progressed , jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot , using his leaping ability to \" fade away \" from block attempts . according to hubie brown , this move alone made him nearly unstoppable . despite media criticism as a \" selfish \" player early in his career , jordan \\'s 5 @.@ 3 assists per game also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates . in later years , the nba shortened its three @-@ point line to 22 feet ( from 23 feet , 9 inches ) , which coupled with jordan \\'s extended shooting range to make him a long @-@ range threat as well — his 3 @-@ point stroke developed from a low 9 / 52 rate ( .173 ) in his rookie year into a stellar 111 / 260 ( .427 ) shooter in the 1995 – 96 season . for a guard , jordan was also a good rebounder ( 6 @.@ 2 per game ) . \\n  in 1988 , jordan was honored with the nba \\'s defensive player of the year award and became the first nba player to win both the defensive player of the year and mvp awards in a career ( since equaled by hakeem olajuwon , david robinson , and kevin garnett ; olajuwon is the only player other than jordan to win both during the

third in nba history in total steals with 2 @,@ 514 , trailing john stockton and jason kidd . jerry west often stated that he was more impressed with jordan \\'s defensive contributions than his

\\'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles . he was also a fixture on the nba all @-@ defensive first team , making the roster nine times ( nba record shared with gary payton , kevin garnett and

history to win an ncaa championship , an nba championship , and an olympic gold medal ( doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 u.s. men \\'s basketball teams ) . \\n  many of jordan \\'s contemporaries say that jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time . in 1999 , an espn survey of journalists , athletes and other sports figures ranked jordan the greatest north american athlete of the 20th century , above such luminaries as babe ruth and muhammad ali . jordan placed second to babe ruth in the associated press \\'s december 1999 list of 20th century athletes . in addition , the

jordan still played defense and an all @-@ around game , but it was never really publicized . \\n  although jordan has done much to increase the status of the game , some of his impact on the game

careers , as well as from the 1992 \" dream team \" . the exhibit also has a batting glove to signify jordan \\'s short career in baseball . after jordan received word of his being accepted into the hall of fame , he selected class of 1996 member david thompson to present him . as jordan would later explain during his induction speech in september 2009 , growing up in north carolina , he was not a fan of the tar heels , and greatly admired thompson , who played at rival north carolina state . he was inducted into the hall in september , with several former bulls teammates in attendance , including scottie pippen , dennis rodman , charles oakley , ron harper , steve kerr , and toni kukoč . former coaches of jordan \\'s , dean smith and doug collins , were also among those present . his

\\n  nike created a signature shoe for him , called the air jordan . one of jordan \\'s more popular commercials for the shoe involved spike lee playing the part of mars blackmon . in the commercials lee , as blackmon , attempted to find the source of jordan \\'s abilities and became convinced that \" it \\'s gotta be the shoes \" . the hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"

attacked and divided among foreign powers . \\n  on 1 september 1939 , germany invaded poland , initiating world war ii in europe , and on 17 september , pursuant to the molotov @-@ ribbentrop pact , poland was invaded by the soviet union . subsequently poland was partitioned again – between these two powers – and remained under occupation for most of the war . by 1 october , germany and the soviet union had completely overrun poland , although the polish government never formally surrendered , and the polish underground state , subordinate to the polish government @-@ in @-@ exile , was soon formed . on 8 october , nazi germany annexed the western areas of pre @-@ war poland and , in the remainder of the occupied area , established the general government . the soviet union had to temporarily give up the territorial gains it made in 1939 due to the german invasion of the soviet union , but permanently re @-@ annexed much of this territory after winning it back in mid @-@ 1944 . over the course of the war , poland lost over 20 % of its pre @-@ war population amid an occupation that marked the end of the second polish republic . \\n  = = destruction of polish culture = = \\n  = = = german occupation = = = \\n  = = = = policy = = = = \\n  germany \\'s policy toward the polish nation and its culture evolved during the course of the war . many german officials and military officers were initially not given any clear guidelines on the treatment of polish cultural institutions , but this quickly changed . immediately following the invasion of poland in september 1939 , the nazi german government implemented the first stages ( the \" small plan \" ) of generalplan ost . the basic policy was outlined by the berlin office of racial policy in a document titled concerning the treatment of the inhabitants of the former polish territories , from a racial @-@ political standpoint . slavic people living east of the pre @-@ war german border were to be germanized , enslaved or eradicated , depending on whether they lived in the territories directly annexed into the german state or in the general government . \\n  much of the german policy on polish culture was formulated during a meeting between the governor of the general government , hans frank , and nazi minister of propaganda joseph goebbels , at łódź on 31 october 1939 . goebbels declared that \" the polish nation is not worthy to be called a cultured nation \" . he and frank agreed that opportunities for the poles to experience their culture should be severely restricted : no theaters , cinemas or cabarets ; no access to radio or press ; and no education . frank suggested that the poles should periodically be shown films highlighting the achievements of the third reich and should eventually be addressed only by megaphone . during the following weeks polish schools beyond middle vocational levels were closed , as were theaters and many other cultural institutions . the only polish @-@ language newspaper published in occupied poland was also closed , and the arrests of polish intellectuals began . \\n  in march 1940 , all cultural activities came under the control of the general government \\'s department of people \\'s education and propaganda ( abteilung für volksaufklärung und propaganda ) , whose name was changed a year later to the \" chief propaganda department \" ( hauptabteilung propaganda ) . further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by frank and goebbels during the previous autumn . one of the department \\'s earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most \" primitive \" of cultural activities without the department \\'s prior approval . spectacles of \" low quality \" , including those of an erotic or pornographic nature , were however an exception — those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the \" real \" polish culture as well as to create the impression that germany was not preventing poles from expressing themselves . german propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized \" polish \" performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic , and presented them as typical polish cultural activities . polish @-@ german cooperation in cultural matters , such as joint public performances , was strictly prohibited . meanwhile , a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in august 1940 . then , in october , the printing of new polish @-@ language books was prohibited ; existing titles were censored , and often confiscated and withdrawn . \\n  in 1941 , german policy evolved further , calling for the complete destruction of the polish people , whom the nazis regarded as \" subhumans \" ( untermenschen ) . within ten to twenty years , the polish territories under german occupation were to be entirely cleared of ethnic poles and settled by german colonists . the policy was relaxed somewhat in the final years of occupation ( 1943 – 44 ) , in view of german military defeats and the approaching eastern front . the germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the polish resistance . poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported german propaganda and indoctrination , such as the newly created chopin museum , which emphasized the composer \\'s invented german roots . restrictions on education , theater and music performances were eased . \\n  given that the second polish republic was a multicultural state , german policies and propaganda also sought to create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups , fueling tension between poles and jews , and between poles and ukrainians . in łódź , the germans forced jews to help destroy a monument to a polish hero , tadeusz kościuszko , and filmed them committing the act . soon afterward , the germans set fire to a jewish synagogue and filmed polish bystanders , portraying them in propaganda releases as a \" vengeful mob . \" this divisive policy was reflected in the germans \\' decision to destroy polish education , while at the same time , showing relative tolerance toward the ukrainian school system . as the high @-@ ranking nazi official erich koch explained , \" we must do everything possible so that when a pole meets a ukrainian , he will be willing to kill the ukrainian and conversely , the ukrainian will be willing to kill the pole . \" \\n  = = = = plunder = = = = \\n  in 1939 , as the occupation regime was being established , the nazis confiscated polish state property and much private property . countless art objects were looted and taken to germany , in line with a plan that had been drawn up well in advance of the invasion . the looting was supervised by experts of the ss @-@ ahnenerbe , einsatzgruppen units , who were responsible for art , and by experts of haupttreuhandstelle ost , who were responsible for more mundane objects . notable items plundered by the nazis included the altar of veit stoss and paintings by raphael , rembrandt , leonardo da vinci , canaletto and bacciarelli . most of the important art pieces had been \" secured \" by the nazis within six months of september 1939 ; by the end of 1942 , german officials estimated that \" over 90 % \" of the art previously in poland was in their possession . some art was shipped to german museums , such as the planned führermuseum in linz , while other art became the private property of nazi officials . over 516 @,@ 000 individual art pieces were taken , including 2 @,@ 800 paintings by european painters ; 11 @,@ 000 works by polish painters ; 1 @,@ 400 sculptures , 75 @,@ 000 manuscripts , 25 @,@ 000 maps , and 90 @,@ 000 books ( including over 20 @,@ 000 printed before 1800 ) ; as well as hundreds of thousands of other objects of artistic and historic value . even exotic animals were taken from the zoos . \\n  = = = = destruction = = = = \\n  many places of learning and culture — universities , schools , libraries , museums , theaters and cinemas — were either closed or designated as \" nur für deutsche \" ( for germans only ) . twenty @-@ five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war . according to one estimate , by war \\'s end 43 % of the infrastructure of poland \\'s educational and research institutions and 14 % of its museums had been destroyed . according to another , only 105 of pre @-@ war poland \\'s 175 museums survived the war , and just 33 of these institutions were able to reopen . of pre @-@ war poland \\'s 603 scientific institutions , about half were totally destroyed , and only a few survived the war relatively intact . \\n  many university professors , as well as teachers , lawyers , artists , writers , priests and other members of the polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed , or transported to concentration camps , during operations such as ab @-@ aktion . this particular campaign resulted in the infamous sonderaktion krakau and the massacre of lwów professors . during world war ii poland lost 39 % to 45 % of its physicians and dentists , 26 % to 57 % of its lawyers , 15 % to 30 % of its teachers , 30 % to 40 % of its scientists and university professors , and 18 % to 28 % of its clergy . the jewish intelligentsia was exterminated altogether . the reasoning behind this policy was clearly articulated by a nazi gauleiter : \" in my district , [ any pole who ] shows signs of intelligence will be shot . \" \\n  as part of their program to suppress polish culture , the german nazis attempted to destroy christianity in poland , with a particular emphasis on the roman catholic church . in some parts of occupied poland , poles were restricted , or even forbidden , from attending religious services . at the same time , church property was confiscated , prohibitions were placed on using the polish language in religious services , organizations affiliated with the catholic church were abolished , and it was forbidden to perform certain religious songs — or to read passages of the bible — in public . the worst conditions were found in the reichsgau wartheland , which the nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti @-@ religious policies . polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for extermination . \\n  to forestall the rise of a new generation of educated poles , german officials decreed that the schooling of polish children would be limited to a few years of elementary education . reichsführer @-@ ss heinrich himmler wrote , in a memorandum of may 1940 : \" the sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic , nothing above the number 500 ; how to write one \\'s name ; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the germans .... i do not regard a knowledge of reading as desirable . \" hans frank echoed him : \" the poles do not need universities or secondary schools ; the polish lands are to be converted into an intellectual desert . \" the situation was particularly dire in the former polish territories beyond the general government , which had been annexed to the third reich . the specific policy varied from territory to territory , but in general , there was no polish @-@ language education at all . german policy constituted a crash @-@ germanization of the populace . polish teachers were dismissed , and some were invited to attend \" orientation \" meetings with the new administration , where they were either summarily arrested or executed on the spot . some polish schoolchildren were sent to german schools , while others were sent to special schools where they spent most of their time as unpaid laborers , usually on german @-@ run farms ; speaking polish brought severe punishment . it was expected that polish children would begin to work once they finished their primary education at age 12 to 15 . in the eastern territories not included in the general government ( bezirk bialystok , reichskommissariat ostland and reichskommissariat ukraine ) many primary schools were closed , and most education was conducted in non @-@ polish languages such as ukrainian , belorussian , and lithuanian . in the bezirk bialystok region , for example , 86 % of the schools that had existed before the war were closed down during the first two years of german occupation , and by the end of the following year that figure had increased to 93 % . \\n  the state of polish primary schools was somewhat better in the general government , though by the end of 1940 , only 30 % of prewar schools were operational , and only 28 % of prewar polish children attended them . a german police memorandum of august 1943 described the situation as follows : \\n  pupils sit crammed together without necessary materials , and often without skilled teaching staff . moreover , the polish schools are closed during at least five months out of the ten months of the school year due to lack of coal or other fuel . of twenty @-@ thirty spacious school buildings which kraków had before 1939 , today the worst two buildings are used ... every day , pupils have to study in several shifts . under such circumstances , the school day , which normally lasts five hours , is reduced to one hour . \\n  in the general government , the remaining schools were subjugated to the german educational system , and the number and competence of their polish staff was steadily scaled down . all universities and most secondary schools were closed , if not immediately after the invasion , then by mid @-@ 1940 . by late 1940 , no official polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation , and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the nazi economy . primary schooling was to last for seven years , but the classes in the final two years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week . there was no money for heating of the schools in winter . classes and schools were to be merged , polish teachers dismissed , and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the german minority or to create barracks for german troops . no new polish teachers were to be trained . the educational curriculum was censored ; subjects such as literature , history and geography were removed . old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed . the new educational aims for poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless , and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to germans . this was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools , police inspections of student belongings , mass arrests of students and teachers , and the use of students as forced laborers , often by transporting them to germany as seasonal workers . \\n  the germans were especially active in the destruction of jewish culture in poland ; nearly all of the wooden synagogues there were destroyed . moreover , the sale of jewish literature was banned throughout poland . \\n  polish literature faced a similar fate in territories annexed by germany , where the sale of polish books was forbidden . the public destruction of polish books was not limited to those seized from libraries , but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes . the last polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943 ; even polish prayer books were confiscated . soon after the occupation began , most libraries were closed ; in kraków , about 80 % of the libraries were closed immediately , while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors . the occupying powers destroyed polish book collections , including the sejm and senate library , the przedziecki estate library , the zamoyski estate library , the central military library , and the rapperswil collection . in 1941 , the last remaining polish public library in the german @-@ occupied territories was closed in warsaw . during the war , warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes , or 30 % of their collections . more than 80 % of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict . overall , it is estimated that about 10 million volumes from state @-@ owned libraries and institutions perished during the war . \\n  polish flags and other symbols were confiscated . the war on the polish language included the tearing down of signs in polish and the banning of polish speech in public places . persons who spoke polish in the streets were often insulted and even physically assaulted . the germanization of place names prevailed . many treasures of polish culture – including memorials , plaques and monuments to national heroes ( e.g. , kraków \\'s adam mickiewicz monument ) – were destroyed . in toruń , all polish monuments and plaques were torn down . dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout poland . the nazis planned to level entire cities . \\n  = = = = censorship and propaganda = = = = \\n  the germans prohibited publication of any regular polish @-@ language book , literary study or scholarly paper . in 1940 , several german @-@ controlled printing houses began operating in occupied poland , publishing items such as polish @-@ german dictionaries and antisemitic and anticommunist novels . \\n  censorship at first targeted books that were considered to be \" serious \" , including scientific and educational texts and texts that were thought to promote polish patriotism ; only fiction that was free of anti @-@ german overtones was permitted . banned literature included maps , atlases and english- and french @-@ language publications , including dictionaries . several non @-@ public indexes of prohibited books were created , and over 1 @,@ 500 polish writers were declared \" dangerous to the german state and culture \" . the index of banned authors included such polish authors as adam mickiewicz , juliusz słowacki , stanisław wyspiański , bolesław prus , stefan żeromski , józef ignacy kraszewski , władysław reymont , stanisław wyspiański , julian tuwim , kornel makuszyński , leopold staff , eliza orzeszkowa and maria konopnicka . mere possession of such books was illegal and punishable by imprisonment . door @-@ to @-@ door sale of books was banned , and bookstores — which required a license to operate — were either emptied out or closed . \\n  poles were forbidden , under penalty of death , to own radios . the press was reduced from over 2 @,@ 000 publications to a few dozen , all censored by the germans . all pre @-@ war newspapers were closed , and the few that were published during the occupation were new creations under the total control of the germans . such a thorough destruction of the press was unprecedented in contemporary history . the only officially available reading matter was the propaganda press that was disseminated by the german occupation administration . cinemas , now under the control of the german propaganda machine , saw their programming dominated by nazi german movies , which were preceded by propaganda newsreels . the few polish films permitted to be shown ( about 20 % of the total programming ) were edited to eliminate references to polish national symbols as well as jewish actors and producers . several propaganda films were shot in polish , although no polish films were shown after 1943 . as all profits from polish cinemas were officially directed toward german war production , attendance was discouraged by the polish underground ; a famous underground slogan declared : \" tylko świnie siedzą w kinie \" ( \" only pigs attend the movies \" ) . a similar situation faced theaters , which were forbidden by the germans to produce \" serious \" spectacles . indeed , a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages . hence , theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground . in addition , actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply . ironically , restrictions on cultural performances were eased in jewish ghettos , given that the germans wished to distract ghetto inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their eventual fate . \\n  music was the least restricted of cultural activities , probably because hans frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music . in time , he ordered the creation of the orchestra and symphony of the general government in its capital , kraków . numerous musical performances were permitted in cafes and churches , and the polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas . visual artists , including painters and sculptors , were compelled to register with the german government ; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground , unless it conveyed propagandist themes . shuttered museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes . \\n  the development of nazi propaganda in occupied poland can be divided into two main phases . initial efforts were directed towards creating a negative image of pre @-@ war poland , and later efforts were aimed at fostering anti @-@ soviet , antisemitic , and pro @-@ german attitudes . \\n  = = = soviet occupation = = = \\n  after the soviet invasion of poland ( beginning 17 september 1939 ) that followed the german invasion that had marked the start of world war ii ( beginning 1 september 1939 ) , the soviet union annexed the eastern parts ( \" kresy \" ) of the second polish republic , comprising 201 @,@ 015 square kilometres ( 77 @,@ 612 sq mi ) and a population of 13 @.@ 299 million . hitler and stalin shared the goal of obliterating poland \\'s political and cultural life , so that poland would , according to historian niall ferguson , \" cease to exist not merely as a place , but also as an idea \" . \\n  the soviet authorities regarded service to the prewar polish state as a \" crime against revolution \" and \" counter @-@ revolutionary activity \" and arrested many members of the polish intelligentsia , politicians , civil servants and academics , as well as ordinary persons suspected of posing a threat to soviet rule . more than a million polish citizens were deported to siberia , many to gulag concentration camps , for years or decades . others died , including over 20 @,@ 000 military officers who perished in the katyn massacres . \\n  the soviets quickly sovietized the annexed lands , introducing compulsory collectivization . they proceeded to confiscate , nationalize and redistribute private and state @-@ owned polish property . in the process , they banned political parties and public associations and imprisoned or executed their leaders as \" enemies of the people \" . in line with soviet anti @-@ religious policy , churches and religious organizations were persecuted . on 10 february 1940 , the nkvd unleashed a campaign of terror against \" anti @-@ soviet \" elements in occupied poland . the soviets \\' targets included persons who often traveled abroad , persons involved in overseas correspondence , esperantists , philatelists , red cross workers , refugees , smugglers , priests and members of religious congregations , the nobility , landowners , wealthy merchants , bankers , industrialists , and hotel and restaurant owners . stalin , like hitler , worked to eliminate polish society . \\n  the soviet authorities sought to remove all trace of the polish history of the area now under their control . the name \" poland \" was banned . polish monuments were torn down . all institutions of the dismantled polish state , including the lwów university , were closed , then reopened , mostly with new russian directors . soviet communist ideology became paramount in all teaching . polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the soviet authorities , and the polish language was replaced with russian or ukrainian . polish @-@ language books were burned even in the primary schools . polish teachers were not allowed in the schools , and many were arrested . classes were held in belorussian , lithuanian and ukrainian , with a new pro @-@ soviet curriculum . as polish @-@ canadian historian piotr wróbel noted , citing british historians m. r. d. foot and i. c. b. dear , majority of scholars believe that \" in the soviet occupation zone , conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the germans . \" in september 1939 , many polish jews had fled east ; after some months of living under soviet rule , some of them wanted to return to the german zone of occupied poland . \\n  all publications and media were subjected to censorship . the soviets sought to recruit polish left @-@ wing intellectuals who were willing to cooperate . soon after the soviet invasion , the writers \\' association of soviet ukraine created a local chapter in lwów ; there was a polish @-@ language theater and radio station . polish cultural activities in minsk and wilno were less organized . these activities were strictly controlled by the soviet authorities , which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former polish government . \\n  the soviet propaganda @-@ motivated support for polish @-@ language cultural activities , however , clashed with the official policy of russification . the soviets at first intended to phase out the polish language and so banned polish from schools , street signs , and other aspects of life . this policy was , however , reversed at times — first before the elections in october 1939 ; and later , after the german conquest of france . in november 1940 , the poles of lwów observed the 85th anniversary of adam mickiewicz \\'s death . soon , however , stalin decided to re @-@ implement the russification policies . he reversed his decision again , however , when a need arose for polish @-@ language pro @-@ soviet propaganda following the german invasion of the soviet union ; as a result stalin permitted the creation of polish forces in the east and later decided to create a communist people \\'s republic of poland . \\n  many polish writers collaborated with the soviets , writing pro @-@ soviet propaganda . they included jerzy borejsza , tadeusz boy @-@ żeleński , kazimierz brandys , janina broniewska , jan brzoza , teodor bujnicki , leon chwistek , zuzanna ginczanka , halina górska , mieczysław jastrun , stefan jędrychowski , stanisław jerzy lec , tadeusz łopalewski , juliusz kleiner , jan kott , jalu kurek , karol kuryluk , leopold lewin , anatol mikułko , jerzy pański , leon pasternak , julian przyboś , jerzy putrament , jerzy rawicz , adolf rudnicki , włodzimierz słobodnik , włodzimierz sokorski , elżbieta szemplińska , anatol stern , julian stryjkowski , lucjan szenwald , leopold tyrmand , wanda wasilewska , stanisław wasilewski , adam ważyk , aleksander weintraub and bruno winawer . \\n  other polish writers , however , rejected the soviet persuasions and instead published underground : jadwiga czechowiczówna , jerzy hordyński , jadwiga gamska @-@ łempicka , herminia naglerowa , beata obertyńska , ostap ortwin , tadeusz peiper , teodor parnicki , juliusz petry . some writers , such as władysław broniewski , after collaborating with the soviets for a few months , joined the anti @-@ soviet opposition . similarly , aleksander wat , initially sympathetic to communism , was arrested by the soviet nkvd secret police and exiled to kazakhstan . \\n  = = underground culture = = \\n  = = = patrons = = = \\n  polish culture persisted in underground education , publications , even theater . the polish underground state created a department of education and culture ( under stanisław lorentz ) which , along with a department of labor and social welfare ( under jan stanisław jankowski and , later , stefan mateja ) and a department for elimination of the effects of war ( under antoni olszewski and bronisław domosławski ) , became underground patrons of polish culture . these departments oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections ( most notably , the giant paintings by jan matejko that were concealed throughout the war ) . they compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families . thus , they sponsored the underground publication ( bibuła ) of works by winston churchill and arkady fiedler and of 10 @,@ 000 copies of a polish primary @-@ school primer and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork ( which was then disseminated by operation n and like activities ) . also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions , theater performances and concerts . \\n  other important patrons of polish culture included the roman catholic church and polish aristocrats , who likewise supported artists and safeguarded polish heritage ( notable patrons included cardinal adam stefan sapieha and a former politician , janusz radziwiłł ) . some private publishers , including stefan kamieński , zbigniew mitzner and the ossolineum publishing house , paid writers for books that would be delivered after the war . \\n  = = = education = = = \\n  in response to the german closure and censorship of polish schools , resistance among teachers led almost immediately to the creation of large @-@ scale underground educational activities . most notably , the secret teaching organization ( tajna organizacja nauczycielska , ton ) was created as early as in october 1939 . other organizations were created locally ; after 1940 they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the ton , working closely with the underground \\'s state department of culture and education , which was created in autumn 1941 and headed by czesław wycech , creator of the ton . classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues . by 1942 , about 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 students took part in underground primary education ; in 1944 , its secondary school system covered 100 @,@ 000 people , and university level courses were attended by about 10 @,@ 000 students ( for comparison , the pre @-@ war enrollment at polish universities was about 30 @,@ 000 for the 1938 / 1939 year ) . more than 90 @,@ 000 secondary @-@ school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly 6 @,@ 000 teachers between 1943 and 1944 in four districts of the general government ( centered on the cities of warsaw , kraków , radom and lublin ) . overall , in that period in the general government , one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations ; the number rose to about 70 % for children old enough to attend secondary school . it is estimated that in some rural areas , the educational coverage was actually improved ( most likely as courses were being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities ) . compared to pre @-@ war classes , the absence of polish jewish students was notable , as they were confined by the nazi germans to ghettos ; there was , however , underground jewish education in the ghettos , often organized with support from polish organizations like ton . students at the underground schools were often also members of the polish resistance . \\n  in warsaw , there were over 70 underground schools , with 2 @,@ 000 teachers and 21 @,@ 000 students . underground warsaw university educated 3 @,@ 700 students , issuing 64 masters and 7 doctoral degrees . warsaw politechnic under occupation educated 3 @,@ 000 students , issuing 186 engineering degrees , 18 doctoral ones and 16 habilitations . jagiellonian university issued 468 masters and 62 doctoral degrees , employed over 100 professors and teachers , and served more than 1 @,@ 000 students per year . throughout poland , many other universities and institutions of higher education ( of music , theater , arts , and others ) continued their classes throughout the war . even some academic research was carried out ( for example , by władysław tatarkiewicz , a leading polish philosopher , and zenon klemensiewicz , a linguist ) . nearly 1 @,@ 000 polish scientists received funds from the underground state , enabling them to continue their research . \\n  the german attitude to underground education varied depending on whether it took place in the general government or the annexed territories . the germans had almost certainly realized the full scale of the polish underground education system by about 1943 , but lacked the manpower to put an end to it , probably prioritizing resources to dealing with the armed resistance . for the most part , closing underground schools and colleges in the general government was not a top priority for the germans . in 1943 a german report on education admitted that control of what was being taught in schools , particularly rural ones , was difficult , due to lack of manpower , transportation , and the activities of the polish resistance . some schools semi @-@ openly taught unauthorized subjects in defiance of the german authorities . hans frank noted in 1944 that although polish teachers were a \" mortal enemy \" of the german states , they could not all be disposed of immediately . it was perceived as a much more serious issue in the annexed territories , as it hindered the process of germanization ; involvement in the underground education in those territories was much more likely to result in a sentence to a concentration camp . \\n  = = = print = = = \\n  there were over 1 @,@ 000 underground newspapers ; among the most important were the biuletyn informacyjny of armia krajowa and rzeczpospolita of the government delegation for poland . in addition to publication of news ( from intercepted western radio transmissions ) , there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics , economics , education , and literature ( for example , sztuka i naród ) . the highest recorded publication volume was an issue of biuletyn informacyjny printed in 43 @,@ 000 copies ; average volume of larger publication was 1 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 copies . the polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary anti @-@ nazi german organizations aimed at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the germans . books were also sometimes printed . other items were also printed , such as patriotic posters or fake german administration posters , ordering the germans to evacuate poland or telling poles to register household cats . \\n  the two largest underground publishers were the bureau of information and propaganda of armia krajowa and the government delegation for poland . tajne wojskowe zakłady wydawnicze ( secret military publishing house ) of jerzy rutkowski ( subordinated to the armia krajowa ) was probably the largest underground publisher in the world . in addition to polish titles , armia krajowa also printed false german newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying german forces ( as part of action n ) . the majority of polish underground presses were located in occupied warsaw ; until the warsaw uprising in the summer of 1944 the germans found over 16 underground printing presses ( whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps ) . the second largest center for polish underground publishing was kraków . there , writers and editors faced similar dangers : for example , almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper na ucho was arrested , and its chief editors were executed in kraków on 27 may 1944 . ( na ucho was the longest published polish underground paper devoted to satire ; 20 issues were published starting in october 1943 . ) the underground press was supported by a large number of activists ; in addition to the crews manning the printing presses , scores of underground couriers distributed the publications . according to some statistics , these couriers were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the germans . \\n  under german occupation , the professions of polish journalists and writers were virtually eliminated , as they had little opportunity to publish their work . the underground state \\'s department of culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals , enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication . novels and anthologies were published by underground presses ; over 1 @,@ 000 works were published underground over the course of the war . literary discussions were held , and prominent

arts and music = = = \\n  with the censorship of polish theater ( and the virtual end of the polish radio and film industry ) , underground theaters were created , primarily in warsaw and kraków , with shows presented in various underground venues . beginning in 1940 the theaters were coordinated by the secret theatrical council . four large companies and more than 40 smaller groups were active throughout the war , even in the gestapo \\'s pawiak prison in warsaw and in auschwitz ; underground acting schools were also created . underground actors , many of whom officially worked mundane jobs , included karol adwentowicz , elżbieta barszczewska , henryk borowski , wojciech brydziński , władysław hańcza , stefan jaracz , tadeusz kantor , mieczysław kotlarczyk , bohdan korzeniowski , jan kreczmar , adam mularczyk , andrzej pronaszko , leon schiller , arnold szyfman , stanisława umińska , edmund wierciński , maria wiercińska , karol wojtyła ( who later became pope john paul ii ) , marian wyrzykowski , jerzy zawieyski and others . theater was also active in the jewish ghettos and in the camps for polish war prisoners . \\n  polish music , including orchestras , also went underground . top polish musicians and directors ( adam didur , zbigniew drzewiecki , jan ekier , barbara kostrzewska , zygmunt latoszewski , jerzy lefeld , witold lutosławski , andrzej panufnik , piotr perkowski , edmund rudnicki , eugenia umińska , jerzy waldorff , kazimierz wiłkomirski , maria wiłkomirska , bolesław woytowicz , mira zimińska ) performed in restaurants , cafes , and private homes , with the most daring singing patriotic ballads on the streets while evading german patrols . patriotic songs were written , such as siekiera , motyka , the most popular song of occupied warsaw . patriotic puppet shows were staged . jewish musicians ( e.g. władysław szpilman ) and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps . although many of them died , some survived abroad , like alexandre tansman in the united states , and eddie rosner and henryk wars in the soviet union . \\n  visual arts were practiced underground as well . cafes , restaurants and private homes were turned into galleries or museums ; some were closed , with their owners , staff and patrons harassed , arrested or even executed . polish underground artists included eryk lipiński , stanisław miedza @-@ tomaszewski , stanisław ostoja @-@ chrostowski , and konstanty maria sopoćko . some artists worked directly for the underground state , forging money and documents , and creating anti @-@ nazi art ( satirical posters and caricatures ) or polish patriotic symbols ( for example kotwica ) . these works were reprinted on underground presses , and those intended for public display were plastered to walls or painted on them as graffiti . many of these activities were coordinated under the action n operation of armia krajowa \\'s bureau of information and propaganda . in 1944 three giant ( 6 m , or 20 ft ) puppets , caricatures of hitler and benito mussolini , were successfully displayed in public places in warsaw . some artists recorded life and death in occupied poland ; despite german bans on poles using cameras , photographs and even films were taken . although it was impossible to operate an underground radio station , underground auditions were recorded and introduced into german radios or loudspeaker systems . underground postage stamps were designed and issued . since the germans also banned polish sport activities , underground sport clubs were created ; underground football matches and even tournaments were organized in warsaw , kraków and poznań , although these were usually dispersed by the germans . all of these activities were supported by the underground state \\'s department of culture . \\n  = = = warsaw uprising = = = \\n  during the warsaw uprising ( august – october 1944 ) , people in polish @-@ controlled territory endeavored to recreate the former day @-@ to @-@ day life of their free country . cultural life was vibrant among both soldiers and the civilian population , with theaters , cinemas , post offices , newspapers and similar activities available . the 10th underground tournament of poetry was held during the uprising , with prizes being weaponry ( most of the polish poets of the younger generation were also members of the resistance ) . headed by antoni bohdziewicz , the home army \\'s bureau of information and propaganda even created three newsreels and over 30 @,@ 000 metres ( 98 @,@ 425 ft ) of film documenting the struggle . \\n  eugeniusz lokajski took some 1 @,@ 000 photographs before he died ; sylwester braun some 3 @,@ 000 , of which 1 @,@ 500 survive ; jerzy tomaszewski some 1 @,@ 000 , of which 600 survived . \\n  = = culture in exile = = \\n  polish artists also worked abroad , outside of occupied europe . arkady fiedler , based in britain with the polish armed forces in the west wrote about the 303 polish fighter squadron . melchior wańkowicz wrote about the polish contribution to the capture of monte cassino in italy . other writers working abroad included jan lechoń , antoni słonimski , kazimierz wierzyński and julian tuwim . there were artists who performed for the polish forces in the west as well as for the polish forces in the east . among musicians who performed for the polish ii corps in a polska parada cabaret were henryk wars and irena anders . the most famous song of the soldiers fighting under the allies was the czerwone maki na monte cassino ( the red poppies on monte cassino ) , composed by feliks konarski and alfred schultz in 1944 . there were also polish theaters in exile in both the east and the west . several polish painters , mostly soldiers of the polish ii corps , kept working throughout the war , including tadeusz piotr potworowski , adam kossowski , marian kratochwil , bolesław leitgeber and stefan knapp . \\n  = = influence on postwar culture = = \\n  the wartime attempts to destroy polish culture may have strengthened it instead . norman davies wrote in god \\'s playground : \" in 1945 , as a prize for untold sacrifices , the attachment of the survivors to their native culture was stronger than ever before . \" similarly , close @-@ knit underground classes , from primary schools to universities , were renowned for their high quality , due in large part to the lower ratio of students to teachers . the resulting culture was , however , different from the culture of interwar poland for a number of reasons . the destruction of poland \\'s jewish community , poland \\'s postwar territorial changes , and postwar migrations left poland without its historic ethnic minorities . the multicultural nation was no more . \\n  the experience of world war ii placed its stamp on a generation of polish artists that became known as the \" generation of columbuses \" . the term denotes an entire generation of poles , born soon after poland regained independence in 1918 , whose adolescence was marked by world war ii . in their art , they \" discovered a new poland \" – one forever changed by the atrocities of world war ii and the ensuing creation of a communist poland . \\n  over the years , nearly three @-@ quarters of the polish people have emphasized the importance of world war ii to the polish national identity . many polish works of art created since the war have centered on events of the war . books by tadeusz borowski , adolf rudnicki , henryk grynberg , miron białoszewski , hanna krall and others ; films , including those by andrzej wajda ( a generation , kanał , ashes and diamonds , lotna , a love in germany , korczak , katyń ) ; tv series ( four tank men and a dog and stakes larger than life ) ; music ( powstanie warszawskie ) ; and even comic books – all of these diverse works have reflected those times . polish historian tomasz szarota wrote in 1996 : \\n  educational and training programs place special emphasis on the world war ii period and on the occupation . events and individuals connected with the war are ubiquitous on tv , on radio and in the print media . the theme remains an important element in literature and learning , in film , theater and the fine arts . not to mention that politicians constantly make use of it . probably no other country marks anniversaries related to the events of world war ii so often or so solemnly . \\n  = arihant @-@ class submarine = \\n  the arihant class ( sanskrit , for killer of enemies ) is a class of nuclear @-@ powered ballistic

pakistani war of 1971 , the us president richard nixon sent a carrier battle group named task force 74 , led by the nuclear @-@ powered uss enterprise into the bay of bengal in an attempt to intimidate india . in response , the soviet union sent a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from vladivostok to trail the us task force . the event demonstrated the significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to then prime minister indira gandhi . following the 1974 smiling buddha nuclear test , the director of marine engineering ( dme ) at naval headquarters initiated a technical feasibility study for an indigenous nuclear propulsion system ( project 932 ) . \\n  the indian navy \\'s advanced technology vessel project to design and construct a nuclear submarine took shape in the 1990s . then defence minister george fernandes confirmed the project in 1998 . the initial intent of the project was to design nuclear @-@ powered fast attack submarines , though following nuclear tests conducted by india in 1998 at pokhran test range and the indian pledge of no first use , the project was re @-@ aligned towards the design of a ballistic missile submarine in order to complete india \\'s nuclear triad . \\n  = = description = = \\n  the arihant @-@ class submarines are nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines built under the advanced technology vessel

@-@ class submarine leased from russia in 2012 . \\n  = = development = = \\n  the submarines are powered by a pressurised water reactor with highly enriched uranium fuel . the miniaturized version of the reactor was designed and built by the bhabha atomic research centre ( barc ) at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research ( igcar ) in kalpakkam . it included a 42 @-@ metre ( 138 ft ) section of the submarine \\'s pressure hull containing the shielding tank with water and the reactor , a control room , as well as an auxiliary control room for monitoring safety parameters . the prototype reactor became critical on 11 november 2003 and was declared operational on 22 september 2006 . successful operation of the prototype for three years enabled the production version of the reactor for arihant . the reactor subsystems were tested at the machinery test center in visakhapatnam . facilities for loading and replacing the fuel cores of the naval reactors in berthed submarines were also established . \\n  the detailed engineering of the design was implemented at larsen & toubro \\'s submarine design center at their hazira shipbuilding facility . tata power sed built the control systems for the submarine . the steam turbines and associated systems integrated with the reactor were supplied by walchandnagar industries . the lead vessel underwent a long and extensive process of testing after its launch in july 2009 . the propulsion and power systems were tested with high @-@ pressure steam trials followed by harbor @-@ acceptance trials that included submersion tests by flooding its ballast tanks and controlled dives to limited depths . ins arihant \\'s reactor went critical for the first time on 10 august 2013 . on 13 december 2014 , the submarine set off for its extensive sea trials . \\n  = = ships in class = = \\n  exact number of planned submarines remains unclear , according to media reports about three to six submarines are planned to be built . the first boat of the class , ins arihant is expected to be commissioned by 2016 . the first four vessels are expected to be commissioned by 2023 . in december 2014 , the work on a second nuclear reactor began and the second boat , ins aridhaman is being prepared for sea trials . the next three ships in the class , after the lead ship , will be larger and have 8 missile launch tubes to carry up to 8 k4 and a more powerful pressurized water reactor than ins arihant . a larger follow on class to the arihant class is also planned , these new boats will be capable of carrying 12 to 16 ballistic missiles . \\n  = = timeline = = \\n  = sms markgraf = \\n  sms markgraf was the third battleship of the four @-@ ship könig class . she served in the imperial german navy during world war i. the battleship was laid down in november 1911 and launched on 4 june 1913 . she was formally commissioned into the imperial navy on 1 october 1914 , just over two months after the outbreak of war in europe . markgraf was armed with ten 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns in five twin turrets and could steam at a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . markgraf was named in honor of the royal family of baden . the name markgraf is a rank of german nobility and is equivalent to the english margrave , or marquess . \\n  along with her three sister ships , könig , grosser kurfürst , and kronprinz , markgraf took part in most of the fleet actions during the war , including the battle of jutland on 31 may and 1 june 1916 . at jutland , markgraf was the third ship in the german line and heavily engaged by the opposing british grand fleet ; she sustained five large @-@ caliber hits and her crew suffered 23 casualties . markgraf also participated in operation albion , the conquest of the gulf of riga , in late 1917 . the ship was damaged by a mine while en route to germany following the successful conclusion of the operation . \\n  after germany \\'s defeat in the war and the signing of the armistice in november 1918 , markgraf and most of the capital ships of the high seas fleet were interned by the royal navy in scapa flow . the ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the allied powers negotiated the final version of the treaty of versailles . on 21 june 1919 , days before the treaty was signed , the commander of the interned fleet , rear admiral ludwig von reuter , ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the british would not be able to seize the ships . unlike most of the scuttled ships , markgraf was never raised for scrapping ; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay . \\n  = = construction and design = = \\n  markgraf was ordered under the provisional name ersatz weissenburg and built at the ag weser shipyard in bremen under construction number 186 . her keel was laid in november 1911 and she was launched on 4 june 1913 . at her launching ceremony , the ship was christened by frederick ii , grand duke of baden , the head of the royal family of baden , in honor of which the ship had been named . fitting @-@ out work was completed by 1 october 1914 , the day she was commissioned into the high seas fleet . she had cost the imperial german government 45 million goldmarks . \\n  markgraf displaced 25 @,@ 796 t ( 25 @,@ 389 long tons ) as built and 28 @,@ 600 t ( 28 @,@ 100 long tons ) fully

commissioning on 1 october 1914 , markgraf conducted sea trials , which lasted until 12 december . by 10 january 1915 , the ship had joined iii battle squadron of the high seas fleet with her three sister ships . on 22 january 1915 , iii squadron was detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver , gunnery , and torpedo training in the baltic . the ships returned to the north sea on 11 february , too late to assist the i scouting group at the battle of dogger bank . \\n  in the aftermath of the loss of sms blücher at the battle of dogger bank , kaiser wilhelm ii removed admiral friedrich von ingenohl from his post as fleet commander on 2 february . admiral hugo von pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet ; von pohl carried out a series of sorties with the high seas fleet throughout 1915 . the first such operation — markgraf \\'s first with the fleet — was a fleet advance to terschelling on 29 – 30 march ; the german fleet failed to engage any british warships during the sortie . another uneventful operation followed on 17 – 18 april , and another three days later on 21 – 22 april . markgraf and the rest of the fleet remained in port until 29 may , when the fleet conducted another two @-@ day advance into the north sea . on 11 – 12 september , markgraf and the rest of iii squadron supported a minelaying operation off texel . another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23 – 24 october . \\n  vice admiral reinhard scheer became commander in chief of the high seas fleet on 18 january 1916 when admiral von pohl became too ill from liver cancer to continue in that post . scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the british grand fleet ; he received approval from the kaiser in february . the first of scheer \\'s operations was conducted the following month , on 5 – 7 march , with an uneventful sweep of the hoofden . another sortie followed three weeks later on the 26th , with another on 21 – 22 april . on 24 april , the battlecruisers of rear admiral franz von hipper \\'s i scouting group conducted a raid on the english coast . markgraf and the rest of the fleet sailed in distant support . the battlecruiser seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target , and had to withdraw . the other battlecruisers bombarded the town of lowestoft unopposed , but during the approach to yarmouth , they encountered the british cruisers of the harwich force . a short artillery duel ensued before the harwich force withdrew . reports of british submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the i scouting group . at this point , scheer , who had been warned of the sortie of the grand fleet from its base in scapa flow , also withdrew to safer german waters . \\n  = = = battle of jutland = = = \\n  markgraf was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of jutland which took place on 31 may and 1 june 1916 . the german fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the grand fleet and destroy it before the main british fleet could retaliate . markgraf was the third ship in the german line , behind her sisters könig and grosser kurfürst and followed by kronprinz . the four ships made up the v division of the iii battle squadron , and they were the vanguard of the fleet . the iii battle squadron was the first of three battleship units ; directly astern were the kaiser @-@ class battleships of the vi division , iii battle squadron . the iii squadron was followed by the helgoland and nassau classes of the ii battle squadron ; in the rear guard were the obsolescent deutschland @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the i battle squadron . \\n  shortly before 16 : 00 the battlecruisers of i scouting group encountered the british 1st battlecruiser squadron under the command of vice admiral david beatty . the opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of indefatigable , shortly after 17 : 00 , and queen mary , less than half an hour later . by this time , the german battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the british ships toward the main body of the high seas fleet . at 17 : 30 , könig \\'s crew spotted both the i scouting group and the 1st battlecruiser squadron approaching . the german battlecruisers were steaming to starboard , while the british ships steamed to port . at 17 : 45 , scheer ordered a two @-@ point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the british battlecruisers , and a minute later , the order to open fire was given . \\n  markgraf opened fire on the battlecruiser tiger at a range of 21 @,@ 000 yards ( 19 @,@ 000 m ) . markgraf and her two sisters fired their secondary guns on british destroyers attempting to make torpedo attacks against the german fleet . markgraf continued to engage tiger until 18 : 25 , by which time the faster battlecruisers managed to move out of effective gunnery range . during this period , the battleships warspite and valiant of the 5th battle squadron fired on the leading german battleships . at 18 : 10 , one of the british ships scored a 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) shell hit on markgraf . shortly thereafter , the destroyer moresby fired a single torpedo at markgraf and missed from a range of about 8 @,@ 000 yd ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) . malaya fired a torpedo at markgraf at 19 : 05 , but the torpedo missed due to the long range . around the same time , markgraf engaged a cruiser from the 2nd light cruiser squadron before shifting her fire back to the 5th battle squadron for ten minutes . during this period , two more 15 @-@ inch shells hit markgraf , though the timing is unknown . the hit at 18 : 10 struck on a joint between two 8 @-@ inch @-@ thick side armor plates ; the shell burst on impact and holed the armor . the main deck was buckled and approximately 400 t ( 390 long tons ; 440 short tons ) of water entered the ship . the other two shells failed to explode and caused negligible damage . \\n  shortly after 19 : 00 , the german cruiser wiesbaden had become disabled by a shell from the british battlecruiser invincible ; rear admiral paul behncke in könig attempted to position his four ships to cover the stricken cruiser . simultaneously , the british iii and iv light cruiser squadrons began a torpedo attack on the german line ; while advancing to torpedo range , they smothered wiesbaden with fire from their main guns . the obsolescent armored cruisers of the 1st cruiser squadron also joined in the melee . markgraf and her sisters fired heavily on the british cruisers , but even sustained fire from the battleships \\' main guns failed to drive them off . markgraf fired both her 30 @.@ 5 cm and 15 cm guns at the armored cruiser defence . under a hail of fire from the german battleships , defence exploded and sank ; credit is normally given to the battlecruiser lützow , though markgraf \\'s gunners also claimed credit for the sinking . \\n  markgraf then fired on the battlecruiser princess royal and scored two hits . the first hit struck the 9 @-@ inch armor covering \" x \" barbette , was deflected downward , and exploded after penetrating the 1 @-@ inch deck armor . the crew for the left gun were killed , the turret was disabled , and the explosion caused serious damage to the upper deck . the second shell penetrated princess royal \\'s 6 @-@ inch belt armor , ricocheted upward off the coal bunker , and exploded under the 1 @-@ inch deck armor . the two shells killed 11 and wounded 31 . at the same time , markgraf \\'s secondary guns fired on the cruiser warrior , which was seriously damaged by 15 heavy shells and forced to withdraw . warrior foundered on the trip back to port the following morning . \\n  around 19 : 30 , admiral john jellicoe \\'s main force of battleships entered the battle ; orion began firing at markgraf at 19 : 32 ; she fired four salvos of 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch armor @-@ piercing , capped ( apc ) shells and scored a hit with the last salvo . the shell exploded upon impacting the armor protecting the no. 6 15 cm gun casemate . the shell failed to penetrate but holed the armor and disabled the gun . the explosion seriously injured two and killed the rest of the gun crew . a heavy shell nearly struck the ship at the same time , and at 19 : 44 , a bent propeller shaft forced markgraf \\'s crew to turn off the port engine ; naval historian john campbell speculated that this shell was the one that damaged the shaft . her speed dropped to 17 or 18 kn ( 31 or 33 km / h ; 20 or 21 mph ) , though she remained in her position in the line . \\n  shortly after 20 : 00 , the german battleships engaged the 2nd light cruiser squadron ; markgraf fired primarily 15 cm shells . in this period , markgraf was engaged by agincourt \\'s 12 @-@ inch guns , which scored a single hit at 20 : 14 . the shell failed to explode and shattered on impact on the 8 @-@ inch side armor , causing minimal damage . two of the adjoining 14 @-@ inch plates directly below the 8 @-@ inch armor were slightly forced inward and some minor flooding occurred . the heavy fire of the british fleet forced scheer to order the fleet to turn away . due to her reduced speed , markgraf turned early in an attempt to maintain her place in the battle line ; this , however , forced grosser kurfürst to fall out of formation . markgraf fell in behind kronprinz while grosser kurfürst steamed ahead to return to her position behind könig . after successfully withdrawing from the british , scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation , though communication errors between scheer aboard friedrich der grosse and westfalen , the lead ship , caused delays . several british light cruisers and destroyers stumbled into the german line around 21 : 20 . in the ensuing short engagement markgraf hit the cruiser calliope five times with her secondary guns . the fleet fell into formation by 23 : 30 , with grosser kurfürst the 13th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships . \\n  around 02 : 45 , several british destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the german line . markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown . but gunners aboard grosser kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes , which prompted markgraf to follow suit . heavy fire from the german battleships forced the british destroyers to withdraw . at 05 : 06 , markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine . \\n  the high seas fleet managed to punch through the british light forces without drawing the attention of jellicoe \\'s battleships , and subsequently reached horns reef by 04 : 00 on 1 june . upon reaching wilhelmshaven , markgraf went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead . the ship was transferred to hamburg where she was repaired in ag vulcan \\'s large floating dock . repair work was completed by 20 july . in the course of the battle , markgraf had fired a total of 254 shells from her main battery and 214 rounds from her 15 cm guns . she was hit by five large @-@ caliber shells , which killed 11 men and wounded 13 . \\n  = = = subsequent operations = = = \\n  following repairs in july 1916 , markgraf went into the baltic for trials . the ship was then temporarily assigned to the i scouting group for the fleet operation on 18 – 19 august . due to the serious damage incurred by seydlitz and derfflinger at jutland , the only battlecruisers available for the operation were von der tann and moltke , which were joined by markgraf , grosser kurfürst , and the new battleship bayern . the british were aware of the german plans , and sortied the grand fleet to meet them . by 14 : 35 , scheer had been warned of the grand fleet \\'s approach and , unwilling to engage the whole of the grand fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close engagement at jutland , turned his forces around and retreated to german ports . \\n  markgraf was present for the uneventful advance in the direction of sunderland on 18 – 20 october . unit training with the iii squadron followed from 21 october to 2 november . two days later , the ship formally rejoined iii squadron . on the 5th , a pair of u @-@ boats grounded on the danish coast . light forces were sent to recover the vessels , and iii squadron , which was in the north sea en route to wilhelmshaven , was ordered to cover them . during the operation , the british submarine j1 torpedoed both grosser kurfürst and kronprinz and caused moderate damage . for most of 1917 , markgraf was occupied with guard duties in the north sea , interrupted only by a refit period in january and periodic unit training in the baltic . \\n  = = = operation albion = = = \\n  in early september 1917 , following the german conquest of the russian port of riga , the german navy decided to eliminate the russian naval forces that still held the gulf of riga . the admiralstab ( navy high command ) planned an operation to seize the baltic island of ösel , and specifically the russian gun batteries on the sworbe peninsula . on 18 september , the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture ösel and moon islands ; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship , moltke , along with the iii and iv battle squadrons of the high seas fleet . the ii squadron consisted of the four könig @-@ class ships , and was by this time augmented with the new battleship bayern . the iv squadron consisted of the five kaiser @-@ class battleships . along with nine light cruisers , three torpedo boat flotillas , and dozens of mine warfare ships , the entire force numbered some 300 ships , supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins . the invasion force amounted to approximately 24 @,@ 600 officers and enlisted men . \\n  opposing the germans were the old russian pre @-@ dreadnoughts slava and tsesarevich , the armored cruisers bayan , admiral makarov , and diana , 26 destroyers , and several torpedo boats and gunboats . three british c @-@ class submarines where also stationed in the gulf . the irben strait , the main southern entrance to the gulf of riga , was heavily mined and defended by a number of coastal artillery batteries . the garrison on ösel numbered nearly 14 @,@ 000 men , though by 1917 it had been reduced to 60 to 70 percent strength . \\n  the operation began on 12 october , when moltke and the four könig @-@ class ships covered the landing of ground troops by suppressing the shore batteries covering tagga bay . markgraf fired on the battery located on cape ninnast . after the successful amphibious assault , iii squadron steamed to putziger wiek , although markgraf remained behind for several days . on the 17th , markgraf left tagga bay to rejoin her squadron in the gulf of riga , but early on the following morning she ran aground at the entrance to kalkgrund . the ship was quickly freed , and she reached the iii squadron anchorage north of larina bank on the 19th . the next day , markgraf steamed to moon sound , and on the 25th participated in the bombardment of russian positions on the island of kynö . the ship returned to arensburg on 27 october , and two days later was detached from operation albion to return to the north sea . \\n  markgraf struck a pair of mines in quick succession while in the irben strait and took in 260 metric tons ( 260 long tons ; 290 short tons ) of water . the ship continued on to kiel via neufahrwasser in danzig ; she then went on to wilhelmshaven , where the mine damage was repaired . the work was completed at the imperial dockyard from 6 to 23 november . after repairs were completed , markgraf returned to guard duty in the north sea . she missed an attempted raid on a british convoy on 23 – 25 april 1918 , as she was in dock in kiel from 15 march to 5 may for the installation of a new foremast . \\n  = = = fate = = = \\n  markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of october 1918 , days before the armistice was to take effect . the bulk of the high seas fleet was to have sortied from their base in wilhelmshaven to engage the british grand fleet . scheer — by now the grand admiral ( großadmiral ) of the fleet — intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the british navy in order to obtain a better bargaining position for germany , despite the expected casualties . however , many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . on the morning of 29 october 1918 , the order was given to sail from wilhelmshaven the following day . starting on the night of 29 october , sailors on thüringen and then on several other battleships , including markgraf , mutinied . the unrest ultimately forced hipper and scheer to cancel the operation . informed of the situation , the kaiser stated , \" i no longer have a navy . \" \\n  following the capitulation of germany in november 1918 , most of the high seas fleet ships , under the command of rear admiral ludwig von reuter , were interned in the british naval base in scapa flow . prior to the departure of the german fleet , admiral adolf von trotha made clear to von reuter that he could not allow the allies to seize the ships , under any conditions . the fleet rendezvoused with the british light cruiser cardiff , which led the ships to the allied fleet that was to escort the germans to scapa flow . the massive flotilla consisted of some 370 british , american , and french warships . once the ships were interned , their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks , and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men . \\n  the fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the treaty of versailles . von reuter believed that the british intended to seize the german ships on 21 june 1919 , which was the deadline for germany to have signed the peace treaty . unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity . on the morning of 21 june , the british fleet left scapa flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 reuter transmitted the order to his ships . markgraf sank at 16 : 45 . the british soldiers in the guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent the germans from scuttling the ships ; they shot and killed markgraf \\'s captain , walter schumann , who was in a lifeboat , and an enlisted man . in total , the guards killed nine germans and wounded twenty @-@ one . the remaining crews , totaling some 1 @,@ 860 officers and enlisted men , were imprisoned . \\n  markgraf was never raised for scrapping , unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled . markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships , which made any salvage attempt more difficult . the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations , and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical . the rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to britain in 1962 . owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons , markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low @-@ background steel , which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices . markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of scapa flow are a popular dive site , and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks . \\n  = coldrum long barrow = \\n  the coldrum long barrow , also known as the coldrum stones and the adscombe stones , is a chambered long barrow located near to the village of trottiscliffe in the south @-@ eastern english county of kent . constructed circa 4000 bce , during britain \\'s early neolithic period , today it survives only in a ruined state . \\n  archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to britain from continental europe . although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across neolithic europe , the coldrum stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the river medway , now known as the medway megaliths . of these , it is in the best surviving condition , and lies near to both addington long barrow and chestnuts long barrow on the western side of the river . three further surviving long barrows , kit \\'s coty house , the little kit \\'s coty house , and the coffin stone , are located on the medway \\'s eastern side . \\n  built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths , the long barrow consisted of a sub @-@ rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb @-@ stones . within the eastern end of the tumulus was a stone chamber , into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the early neolithic . osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals , a mixture of men , women , children and adults . at least one of the bodies had been dismembered prior to burial , potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial . as with other barrows , coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead , perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration , although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious , ritual , and cultural connotations and uses . \\n  after the early neolithic , the long barrow fell into a state of ruined dilapidation , perhaps experiencing deliberate deposition in the late medieval period , either by christian zealots or treasure hunters . local folklore grew up around the site , associating it with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif . the ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 19th century , while archaeological excavation took place in the early 20th . after limited reconstruction , in 1926 ownership was transferred to heritage charity the national trust . it is open without charge to visitors all year around . \\n  = = name and location = = \\n  the coldrum stones are named after a nearby farm , coldrum lodge , which has since been demolished . the monument lies in a \" rather isolated site \" north @-@ east of the nearby village of trottiscliffe , about 500 metres from a prehistoric track known as the pilgrim \\'s way . the tomb can be reached along a pathway known as coldrum lane , which is only accessible on foot . the nearest car park to coldrum lane can be found off of pinesfield lane in trottiscliffe . another nearby village is addington , which is located one and a quarter miles away . \\n  = = context = = \\n  = = = early neolithic britain = = = \\n  the early neolithic was a revolutionary period of british history . beginning in the fifth millennium bce , it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the british isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence , abandoning the hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding mesolithic period . archaeologists have been unable to prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental europe or because the indigenous mesolithic britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies . either way , it certainly emerged through contact with continental europe , probably as a result of centuries of interaction between mesolithic people living in south @-@ east britain and linear pottery culture ( lbk ) communities in north @-@ eastern france . the region of modern kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental european settlers and visitors , because of its position on the estuary of the river thames and its proximity to the continent . \\n  between 4500 and 3800 bce , all of the british isles came to abandon its former mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle , to be replaced by the new agricultural subsistence of the neolithic age . although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the british isles in this period , there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement , architectural styles , and the use of natural resources . throughout most of britain , there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period , leading archaeologists to believe that the early neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral , relying on herding cattle , with people living a nomadic or semi @-@ nomadic way of life . although witnessing some land clearance , britain was largely forested in this period , and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of kent had experienced in the early neolithic ; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south @-@ east britain in the late bronze age . environmental data from the area around the white horse stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the early neolithic , covered by a woodland of oak , ash , hazel / alder and maloideae . \\n  = = = the tomb building tradition = = = \\n  across western europe , the early neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape . these were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead , and though sometimes constructed out of timber , many were built using large stones , now known as \" megaliths \" . individuals were rarely buried alone in the early neolithic , instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community . the construction of these collective burial monumental tombs , both wooden and megalithic , began in continental europe before being adopted in britain in the first half of the fourth millennium bce . \\n  the early neolithic people of britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their mesolithic forebears had done . many archaeologists have suggested that this is because early neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead , believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants . archaeologist robin holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs , the medway megaliths were \" communal mouments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them . \" thus , it has furthermore been suggested that early neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance . for this reason , historian ronald hutton termed these monuments \" tomb @-@ shrines \" to reflect their dual purpose . \\n  in britain , these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape , perhaps at the junction between different territories . archaeologist caroline malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on \" territory , political allegiance , ownership , and ancestors . \" many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb @-@ shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups , although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society . instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways . many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land , thus representing a change in mindset brought about by neolithicisation . others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers . \\n  archaeologists have differentiated these early neolithic tombs into a variety of different architectural styles , each typically associated with a different region within the british isles . passage graves , characterised by their narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone , were predominantly located in northern britain and southern and central ireland . alternately , across northern ireland and central britain long chambered mounds predominated , while in the east and south @-@ east of britain , earthen long barrows represented the dominant architectural trend . these earthen long barrows were typically constructed of timber because building stone was scarce in southern britain ; archaeologist aubrey burl argued that these timber tombs might have been \" even more eye @-@ catching \" than their stone counterparts , perhaps consisting of \" towering carved poles , flamboyantly painted \" , but that evidence of such sculptures has not survived . the medway megaliths represent just one of these regional groups within the wider west european tradition of tomb building in this period . \\n  = = = the medway megaliths = = = \\n  although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance , at the time of construction the medway megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing early neolithic funerary monuments in britain . grouped along the river medway as it cuts through the north downs , they constitute the most south @-@ easterly group of megalithic monuments in the british isles , and the only megalithic group in eastern england . archaeologists brian philp and mike dutto deemed the medway megaliths to be \" some of the most interesting and well known \" archaeological sites in kent , while archaeologist paul ashbee described them as \" the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern england \" . \\n  they can be divided into two separate clusters : one to the west of the river medway and the other on blue bell hill to the east , with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 km . the western group includes coldrum long barrow , addington long barrow , and the chestnuts long barrow . the eastern group consists of kit \\'s coty house , little kit \\'s coty house , the coffin stone , and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs . it is not known if they were all built at the same time , or whether they were constructed in succession , while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage . \\n  the medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan , and are all aligned on an east to west axis . each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound , and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance . the chambers were constructed from sarsen , a dense , hard , and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout kent , having formed out of silicified sand from the eocene . early neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area , and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected . \\n  such common architectural features among these tomb @-@ shrines indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the british isles . for instance , they would have been taller than most other tomb @-@ shrines in britain , with internal heights of up to 10 ft . nevertheless , as with other regional groupings of early neolithic tomb @-@ shrines ( such as the cotswold @-@ severn group ) , there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments , such as coldrum \\'s rectilinear shape , the chestnut long barrow \\'s facade , and the long , thin mounds at addington and kit \\'s coty . this variation might have been caused by the tomb @-@ shrines being altered and adapted over the course of their use ; in this scenario , the monuments would represent composite structures . \\n  it seems apparent that the people who built these monuments were influenced by pre @-@ existing tomb @-@ shrines that they were already aware of . whether those people had grown up locally , or moved into the medway area from elsewhere is not known . based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs , stuart piggott thought that they had originated in the area around the low countries , while glyn daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from scandinavia . john h. evans instead suggested an origin in germany , and ronald f. jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the cotswold @-@ severn megalithic group . ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb @-@ shrine traditions of continental northern europe , and emphasised that the medway megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across early neolithic europe . he nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was \" impossible to indicate \" with the available evidence . \\n  = = design and construction = = \\n  the monument originally consisted of a sarsen stone chamber , covered by a low earthen mound , which was bounded by prostrate slabs . as such , the archaeologist paul ashbee asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features : the chamber , the barrow , and the sarsen stone surround . it is located on the edge of a large lynchet scarp , although it is difficult to ascertain what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction , due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was . however , if the area was not highly wooded , then 360 ° views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible . the monument \\'s axis points toward both the north downs and the medway valley , which is similar to the other medway megaliths . archaeologist sian killick suggested that the coldrum long barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement , and that this \" may have been a key factor in the experience of ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape . \" \\n  it had been built using about 50 stones . the barrow is sub @-@ rectangular in plan , and about 20 meters ( 64 feet ) in length . at its broader , eastern end , where the chamber is located , the monument measures 15 metres ( 50 feet ) , while at the narrower , western end , it is 12 metres ( 40 feet ) in breadth . as such , the barrow is a \" truncated wedge @-@ shape \" . the megalithic builders responsible for the coldrum stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the north downs , and constructed it facing eastward , towards the river medway . \\n  the chamber of the monument measures 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 13 feet ) in length , and 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 feet 6 inches ) in width , although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed . the chamber \\'s internal height would have been at least 2 metres ( 6 feet 6 inches ) . in its current state , the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs , one being 8 feet long , 7 feet , 6 inches deep , and 1 foot , 9 inches thick , and the other 5 feet long , 6 feet deep , and 2 feet thick . conversely , the chamber \\'s southern side consists of a single slab , measuring 11 feet , 4 inches in length , 7 feet , 3 inches in depth , and 1 foot , 9 inches in depth at its thicker , eastern end . the western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about 14 feet , 6 inches wide , with a thickness of 1 foot and a depth of around 8 feet . a collapsed , broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber . it is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber . excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens ; twentieth @-@ century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement , allowing the stones to continue standing upright . \\n  it is possible that there was a facade in front of the chamber , as is evident at other chambered tombs in britain , such as west kennet long barrow and wayland \\'s smithy . it is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber , as was apparent at kit \\'s coty house and lower kit \\'s coty house . many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal . \\n  the earthen mound that once covered the tomb is now visible only as an undulation approximately 1 foot , 6 inches in height . in the nineteenth @-@ century , the mound was higher on the western end of the tomb , although this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath during the 1920s . it is likely that in the early neolithic , the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it , and it is inside this ditch that the kerb @-@ stones now sit . \\n  the kerb @-@ stones around the tomb display some patterning ; those on the northern side are mostly rectilinear , while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape . it is probable that there was an ancillary dry @-@ stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological folkestone beds , as is evident at chestnuts long barrow . given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally , it may have been quarried . \\n  a concave line of abrasion and polishing can be found on both one of the central kerb @-@ stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb @-@ stone on the south @-@ east of the monument . these have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe @-@ blades on these sarsens . it is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb . similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at west kennet long barrow , as well as later prehistoric monuments such as stonehenge . \\n  coldrum long barrow is comparatively isolated from the other medway megaliths ; in this it is unique , given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups . however , it is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby ; a razed , elongated earthen mound with an east @-@ west orientation is located in a hollow at the foot of the downs just under a quarter of a mile to the north of the coldrum stones . it may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried . several large sarsens to the south of the coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb , since destroyed . \\n  = = human remains = = \\n  = = = demographics = = = \\n  ashbee suggested that given its size and comparisons with other long barrows , such as fussell \\'s lodge , the coldrum tomb could have housed the remains of over a hundred individuals . excavations conducted in the early 20th century have led to the methodical discovery and removal of what was believed to be the remains of twenty @-@ two human individuals . these remains were examined by sir arthur keith , the conservator of the museum at the royal college of surgeons . he published his results in 1913 , in a paper largely concerned with discerning racial characteristics of the bodies . \\n  a subsequent re @-@ analysis of the bones was conducted in the early 21st century , and published in the proceedings of the prehistoric society in 2013 : the project presented \" osteological analysis , bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates , and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to inform on the demography , burial practices , diet and subsistence , and chronology of the coldrum population \" . disputing earlier conclusions , it stated that the minimum number of individuals was seventeen . these were then further identified as probably belonging to nine adults ( probably five males and four females ) , two sub @-@ adults , four older children , and two younger children ( one around five years old , the other between 24 and 30 months old ) . \\n  keith had suggested that the crania he examined displayed similar features , which he attributed to the different individuals belonging to \" one family - or several families united by common descent . \" similar observations had been made regarding the crania from other long barrows in britain , although osteoarchaeologists martin smith and megan brickley noted that this was not necessarily representative of a family group . instead , they stated that it would also be consistent with \" a population that was still relatively small and scattered \" , in which most individuals were interrelated . \\n  wysocki \\'s team noted that in all but one case , the fracture morphologies are consistent with dry @-@ bone breakage . three of the skulls exhibited evidence that they had experienced violence ; a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on the left frontal , while an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on the left frontal , and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on the right frontal . \\n  isotope analysis of the remains revealed δ13c values that were typical of those found at many other southern british neolithic sites , albeit with significantly higher values of δ15c , which grew over time . although this data is difficult to interpret , it was identified as probably reflecting a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods . in the case of the older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb , the tooth enamel was worn away and the dentine had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns . \\n  radiocarbon dating of the remains suggested early neolithic activity began at the site during 3980 – 3800 calibrated bce ( 95 % probability ) or 3960 – 3880 cal bce ( 68 % probability ) , when the first human remains were buried at the site . it then suggested that after an interval of either 60 – 350 years ( 95 % probability ) or 140 – 290 years ( 68 % probability ) , further depositions of human remains were made inside the tomb . this second phase probably began in 3730 – 3540 cal bce ( 95 % probability ) or 3670 – 3560 cal bce ( 68 % probability ) . the radiocarbon dating of the human remains does not provide a date for the construction of coldrum long barrow itself ; it is possible that the individuals died either some time before or after the monument \\'s construction . \\n  = = = post @-@ mortem deposition = = = \\n  cut @-@ marks were identified on a number of the bones ( two femora , two innominates , and one cranium ) , with osteoarchaeological specialists suggesting that these had been created post @-@ mortem as the bodies were dismembered and the bones removed from their attached ligaments . however , they further suggested that the lack of such cut @-@ marks on certain bones was suggestive that the body had already undergone partial decomposition or the removal of soft tissues prior to the process of dismemberment . the precision of the cut @-@ marks suggests that this dismemberment was done carefully ; \" they do not suggest frenzied hacking or mutilation . \" none of the criteria that osteoarchaeologists deem diagnostic of cannibalism were found on the bones . \\n  this cut @-@ marked human bone assemblage represented the largest yet identified from within a neolithic long barrow in southern britain , although similar evidence for dismemberment has been found from a number of other neolithic british sites , such as west trump , eyford , aldestrop , and haddenham . there are two possibilities for how this material developed . the first is that the bodies of the dead were excarnated or exposed to the elements , followed by a secondary burial within the tomb . the second is that they were placed in the tomb , where the flesh decomposed , before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself . these practices may have been accompanied by necrophagy , shamanism , or magical practices , direct evidence for which does not survive . \\n  the inclusion of occupational debris over the bones was not unique to the site but common in chambered tombs from southern england . on the basis of an example discovered at kit \\'s coty house , ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the coldrum \\'s chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs , which served the same purpose as the side chambers of west kennet and wayland \\'s smithy . \\n  = = damage and dilapidation = = \\n  all of the surviving megalithic tombs from the early neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the ravages of agriculture . although archaeologist paul ashbee noted that the coldrum stones represent \" kent \\'s least damaged megalithic long barrow \" , it too has suffered considerable damage , having become dilapidated and fallen apart over the six millennia since its original construction . most prominently , the eastern side has largely collapsed , with the stones that once helped to hold up the side of the barrow having fallen to the bottom of the slope . conversely , it is possible that the sarsens at the bottom of the slope were not part of the original monument , but were stones found in nearby fields which were deposited there by farmers . \\n  excavation of chestnuts long barrow revealed that it had been systematically destroyed in one event , and ashbee suggested that the same may have happened to the coldrum stones . he believed that the kerb @-@ stones around the barrow were toppled , laid prostrate in the surrounding ditch , and then buried during the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century , by christians seeking to obliterate non @-@ christian monuments . conversely , the archaeologist john alexander — who excavated chestnuts — suggested that the medway tombs were destroyed by robbers seeking to locate treasure within them . as evidence , he pointed to the close roll of 1237 , which ordered the opening of barrows on the isle of wight in search for treasure , a practice which may have spread to kent around the same time . alexander believed that the destruction n kent may have been brought about by a special commissioner , highlighting that the \" expertness and thoroughness of the robbery \" at chestnuts would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce . ashbee further suggested that in subsequent centuries , locals raided the damaged coldrum tomb for loamy chalk and stone , which was then re @-@ used as building material . \\n  = = folklore and folk tradition = = \\n  in a 1946 paper published in the folklore journal , john h. evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the coldrum stones , and that a \" black prince \" was buried within its chamber . he suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other medway megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \" percolated down from the theories of antiquaries \" who believed that the early medieval battle of aylesford , which was recorded in the anglo @-@ saxon chronicle , took place in the area . \\n  evans also recorded that there was a folk belief in the area that applied to all of the medway megaliths and which had been widespread \" up to the last generation \" ; this was that it was impossible for any human being to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments . this \" countless stones \" motif is not unique to this particular site , and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in britain . the earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early sixteenth @-@ century document , where it applies to the stone circle of stonehenge in wiltshire , although in an early seventeenth @-@ century document it was being applied to the hurlers , a set of three stone circles in cornwall . later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in england , as well as a single occurrence each in wales and ireland . the folklorist s. p. menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own . \\n  in the early twenty @-@ first century , a tradition developed in which the hartley morris men , a morris dancing side , travel to the site at dawn every may day in order to \" sing up the sun \" . this consists of a number of dances performed within the stones on top of the barrow , followed by a song performed at the base of the monument . \\n  = = antiquarian and archaeological investigation = = \\n  = = = early antiquarian descriptions = = = \\n  the earliest antiquarian accounts of coldrum long barrow were never published . there are claims that at the start of the nineteenth century , the reverend mark noble , rector of barming , prepared a plan of the site for gentleman \\'s magazine , although no copies have been produced to verify this . between 1842 and 1844 , the reverend beale post authored druidical remains at coldrum , in which he described the monument , although it remained unpublished at the time . associating the site with the druids of britain \\'s iron age , post \\'s suggestion was that the name \" coldrum \" derived from the linguistically celtic \" gael @-@ dun \" , and that the chiefs of some of the belgic gauls were interned there . he further reported that in both 1804 and 1825 , skulls had been found at the site . in 1844 , an antiquarian named thomas wright published a note on the coldrum stones and other medway megaliths in the archaeological journal . wright had been alerted to their existence by a local vicar , the reverend lambert b. larking , and proceeded to visit them with him . describing the coldrums , wright mentioned \" a smaller circle of stones \" to the others in the area , with \" a subterranean cromlech in the middle \" . he further added that \" it is a tradition of the peasantry that a continuous line of stones ran from coldrum direct to the well @-@ known monument called kit \\'s cotty [ sic ] house \" , attributing this belief to the variety of megaliths which were scattered throughout the landscape . \\n  in 1857 , the antiquarian j. m. kemble excavated at the site with the help of the reverend larking , providing a report of their findings to the central committee of the british archaeological association . describing the monument as a stone circle , they asserted that they discovered anglo @-@ saxon pottery at the site , and noted that as well as being called the coldrum stones , the monument also had the name of the adscombe stones , which kemble believed originated with the old english word for funeral pile , ad . in august 1863 , the archaeological institute , who were then holding their week @-@ long meeting in rochester , took a tour to visit the site , guided by the antiquary charles roach smith . that year , the monument was described in a copy of gentleman \\'s magazine by yorkshire antiquary charles moore jessop , who believed it to be a \" celtic \" stone circle . \\n  in 1869 , the antiquarian a. l. lewis first visited the site , and was informed by locals that several years previously a skull had been uncovered from inside or near to the chamber , but that they believed it to be that of a gypsy . a later account elaborated on this , stating that two individuals excavated in the centre of the dolmen without permission , discovering a human skeleton , the skull of which was then re @-@ buried in the churchyard at meopham . in an 1878 note published in the journal of the anthropological institute of great britain and ireland , lewis noted that while many tourists visited kit \\'s coty house , \" very few goes to or ever hears of a yet more curious collection of stones at colderham or coldrum lodge \" . he believed that the monument consisted of both a \" chamber \" and an \" oval \" of stones , suggesting that they were \" two distinct erections \" . in 1880 , the archaeologist flinders petrie included the existence of the stones at \" coldreham \" in his list of kentish earthworks ; although noting that a previous commentator had described the stones as being in the shape of an oval , he instead described them as forming \" a rectilinear enclosure \" around the chamber . he then included a small , basic plan of the monument . \\n  in august 1889 , two amateur archaeologists , george payne and a. a. arnold , came across the monument , which they noted was known among locals as the \" coldrum stones \" and \" druid temple \" ; according to payne , \" the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood that they could not be discerned \" . he returned the next year , noting that at this point , the brushwood had been cut away to reveal the megaliths . in his 1893 book collectanea cantiana , payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844 , \" since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan \" , an unusual claim given that a copy of petrie \\'s published plan existed in his library . for this reason , after gaining permission from the landowner , he convinced major a. o. green , instructor in survey at brompton , to conduct a survey of the monument in august 1892 . he also wrote to the archaeologist augustus pitt @-@ rivers , encouraging him to schedule the coldrum stones as a legally protected site under the ancient monuments protection act 1882 . payne described the coldrum stones as \" the finest monument of its class in the county , and one worthy of every care and attention . \" comparing it to other monuments of its type in britain , he asserted that it was undoubtedly \" of sepulchral origin , belonging to a period anterior to the roman domination of britain . \" payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting coldrum to the addington long barrow , although added that he was unable to discover any evidence for the existence of this feature . \\n  in 1904 , george clinch published a note on the medway megaliths in the royal anthropological institute \\'s journal , man , in which he referred to the coldrum stones as \" at once the most remarkable and the least known of the whole series . \" suggesting that its design indicates that it was built during \" a late date in the neolithic age \" , he compared the workmanship in producing the megaliths to that at the stone circle of stonehenge in wiltshire , although noted that they differed in that the coldrum stones clearly represented \" a sepulchral pile \" . ultimately , he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the ancient monuments protection act 1900 . in that same issue , lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see \" no evidence that anything of that kind ever existed \" , and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle , comparing it to the examples at avebury , arborlow , and stanton drew , suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine . \\n  = = = archaeological excavation = = = \\n  the coldrum stones have been excavated on multiple occasions . on 16 april 1910 , the amateur archaeologist f. j. bennett began excavation at the site , after previously having uncovered some neolithic lithics from addington long barrow . he soon discovered human bones \" under only a few inches of chalky soil \" . he returned to the site for further excavation in august 1910 , this time with his niece and her husband , both of whom were dentists with an interest in craniology ; on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull , which they were able to largely reconstruct . a few days later he returned to excavate on the north @-@ west corner of the dolmen with the architect e. w. filkins ; that day , they found a second skull , further bones , a flint tool , and pieces of pottery . \\n  later that month , george payne and f. w. reader met with bennett to discuss his finds . with the aid of two other interested amateur archaeologists , mr boyd and miss harker , both from malling , excavation resumed in early september . in 2009 , the archaeologists martin smith and megan brickley asserted that bennett \\'s excavations had taken heed of the advice of pitt @-@ rivers that excavations should be recorded in full . they noted that bennett had provided \" clear plan and section drawings , photographs of the monument and careful attempts to consider site formation processes . \" suggesting that the monument was constructed on agricultural land , in his published report bennett cited the ideas of anthropologist james frazer in the golden bough to suggest that the coldrum stones \" monument may at one time have been dedicated , though not necessarily initially so , to the worship of the corn god and of agriculture . \" he proceeded to theorise that the human remains found at the site were the victims of human sacrifice killed in fertility rites . however , evans later stated that \" we have no means of knowing \" whether human sacrifice had taken place at the site . \\n  in september 1922 , filkins once again began excavating at the site , this time with the aid of a resident of gravesend , charles gilbert . their project was financed through grants provided by the british association and the society of antiquaries , with filkins noting that at the time of its commencement , \" a miniature jungle \" had grown up around the site which had to be cleared . excavation continued sporadically until at least 1926 . human remains were discovered , and placed into the possession of sir arthur keith of the royal college of surgeons . this excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument , a number of which had previously been buried beneath earth . the stones of the dolmen were shored up with concrete foundations where filkins deemed it necessary . although filkins \\' excavation was comprehensive , it did ignore stone holes , packing stones , and their relationship to the mound . in 1998 , ashbee noted that while from \" a present @-@ day perspective , it is possible to see shortcomings [ ... ] in terms of the general standards of the early part of this century , there is much to commend . \" \\n  = = = management by the national trust = = = \\n  in his 1924 publication dealing with kent , the archaeologist o. g. s. crawford , then working as the archaeological officer for the ordnance survey , listed the coldrum stones alongside the other medway megaliths . in 1926 , the coldrum stones were given to the national trust , who dedicated it as a memorial to the kentish historian benjamin harrison . a plaque was erected to mark this , which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle ; in 1953 , the archaeologist leslie grinsell expressed the view that \" it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future \" . still owned by the trust , the site is open to visitors all year round , free of charge . on their website , the trust advises visitors to look for \" stunning views from the top of the barrow \" . john h. evans characterised the site as \" the most impressive \" of the medway megaliths , while grinsell described it as \" the finest and most complete \" of the group . \\n  = soviet cruiser krasnyi kavkaz = \\n  krasnyi kavkaz ( from russian : \" красный кавказ \" - \" red caucasus \" ) was a cruiser of the soviet navy that began construction during world war i , but was still incomplete during the russian revolution . her design was heavily modified by the soviets and she was completed in 1932 . during world war ii she supported soviet troops during the siege of odessa , siege of sevastopol , and the kerch @-@ feodosiya operation in the winter of 1941 — 42 . she was awarded the guards title on 3 april 1942 . she was reclassified as a training ship in may 1947 before being used as a target in 1952 . \\n  = = service history = = \\n  laid down on 18 october 1913 at the rossud dockyard as admiral lazarev for the imperial russian navy as a cruiser of the svetlana class , she was launched on 8 june 1916 . construction was abandoned in 1917 during the october revolution when the ship was 63 % complete . in the second half of 1918 , the marine department of hetman pavlo skoropadskyi was engaged in completion of ship . on 25 january 1919 , the ship was formally renamed in \" hetman petro doroshenko \" , but mykolaiv was captured shortly afterward by the entente . the hull was relatively undamaged and the soviets decided to finish the ship to a modified design . she was renamed krasnyi kavkaz on 14 december 1926 , and completed to a modernized design , being commissioned on 25 january 1932 . \\n  krasnyi kavkaz was initially intended to accommodate eight 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns in four twin turrets , but this was impossible given her small and lightly constructed hull . three twin turrets mounting the new 57 @-@ caliber 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) b @-@ 1 @-@ k gun under development also proved impracticable and the soviets had to settle for four mk @-@ 1 @-@ 180 single 180 mm gun turrets , two at each end . her superstructure was massively revised to fit these turrets and all of the original casemated 130 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) / 55 b7 pattern 1913 guns were removed . as completed her secondary armament was only four 30 @-@ caliber 76 @.@ 2 mm lender aa guns mounted between her funnels . her original internal torpedo tubes were replaced by four triple 533 @-@ millimetre ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo mounts mounted on each side of the main deck abaft the forecastle break . she was given an aircraft @-@ handling crane , but a catapult wasn \\'t installed aft of her rear funnel until 1935 when a heinkel catapult was imported from germany . she was also fitted for mine rails with a capacity of up to 120 mines . \\n  the light cruiser komintern collided with her in may 1932 , shortly after her commissioning , and badly damaged her bow . it was extensively rebuilt and increased her overall length by over 11 metres ( 36 ft ) . in 1933 she made port visits in turkey , greece and italy . \\n  she was refitted before operation barbarossa , probably about 1940 , her catapult was removed , and her anti @-@ aircraft armament was greatly increased . her four 76 @.@ 2 mm lender aa guns were exchanged for four italian minizini twin gun 50 @-@ caliber 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) aa mounts and she received four single mounts for the semi @-@ automatic 76 @.@ 2 mm 34 @-@ k were fitted as well as six 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) aa machine guns . two single mounts for 76 @.@ 2 mm ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) 34 @-@ k guns were also fitted , one on each side of the quarterdeck just aft of the rearmost main gun turret . some of these guns may have been received earlier , the sources are unclear . while under repair at poti in late 1942 she landed her aft pair of torpedo tubes and received two more minizini mounts salvaged from the sunken cruiser chervona ukraina . ten single mounts for the naval version of the 37 mm aa gun was also fitted . by 1944 she was also carrying one quadruple vickers .50 machine gun mk iii mount on top of each of her superfiring main gun turrets and she may have been using oerlikon 20 mm cannon . \\n  = = = world war ii = = = \\n  krasnyi kavkaz , in company with the cruisers chervona ukraina , komintern and a number of destroyers , laid down a defensive mine barrage protecting the black sea fleet base at sevastopol on 22 june . she provided gunfire support to soviet forces defending odessa and escorted convoys bringing the 157th rifle division into odessa during the month of september 1941 . she also transported one battalion of the 3rd marine regiment from sevastopol in a successful amphibious assault behind romanian lines to destroy romanian coastal batteries near fontanka and dofinovka . she escorted convoys from 3 — 6 october that evacuated the 157th rifle division from odessa to sevastopol and escorted the final evacuation convoy during the night of 15 – 16 october . during the siege of sevastopol she provided gunfire support and evacuated cut @-@ off troops from elsewhere in the crimea into sevastopol and brought in reinforcements from caucasian ports . she helped to transport the 388th rifle division from novorossiysk and tuapse to sevastopol between 7 and 13 december and the 354th rifle division between 21 and 22 december , bombarding german positions in the interim . \\n  during the kerch @-@ feodosiya operation krasnyi kavkaz sailed into the harbor of feodosiya on 29 december 1941 and disembarked reinforcements and provided gunfire support for soviet troops already ashore . she was hit seventeen times by axis artillery and mortar fire in retaliation . on 1 and 3 january she ferried supplies and reinforcements for the soviet bridgehead on the kerch peninsula . on the return voyage she was severely damaged by german junkers ju 87 stuka dive @-@ bombers from ii . / stg 77 . four near @-@ misses close to her stern damaged her steering , her left propeller shaft , blew off one propeller and put enough holes in her stern that flooding caused her draft to increase by 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . she made it to novorossiysk , escorted by the destroyer sposobnyi , where she was patched up enough to make to poti where more permanent repairs could be made . these took until october 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti @-@ aircraft armament . \\n  she was awarded the guards title on 3 april in recognition of her performance . between 20 and 23 october , krasnyi kavkaz , her half @-@ sister krasnyi krym , and three destroyers ferried 12 @,@ 600 men of the 8th , 9th and 10th guards rifle brigades from poti to tuapse to reinforce the defenses there . on the night of 4 february 1943 the soviets made a series of amphibious landings to the west of novorossiysk , behind german lines . krasnyi krym , krasnyi kavkaz , and three destroyers provided fire support for the main landing , but the soviet troops there were wiped out by 6 february , although one secondary landing was successful . the loss of three destroyers attempting to interdict the german evacuation of the taman bridgehead on 6 october 1943 caused stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant the end of krasnyi kavkaz \\'s active participation in the war . \\n  = = = post @-@ war history = = = \\n  little is

beaches of narragansett and south kingstown , and the city of newport . route 4 begins as a two @-@ lane divided highway at an intersection with u.s. route 1 ( us 1 ) in the town of north kingstown , becoming a limited @-@ access freeway after 1 @.@ 89 miles ( 3 @.@ 04 km ) . the route has four numbered interchanges before terminating in the city of warwick , where the northbound lanes merge into interstate 95 ( i @-@ 95 ) . \\n  the origins of route 4 date back to 1952 , when construction began on a short , unnumbered arterial from us 1 to the modern location of exit 5 at routes 2 and 102 in wickford . in 1965 , the rhode island department of public works began work on a 5 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) freeway from modern exit 6 north to the merge with i @-@ 95 . the freeway , designated as route 4 , was completed in 1972 . at that time , the route 4 designation was also applied to the wickford arterial . in 1988 , the missing link in route 4 between exits 5 and 6 was completed and opened . the rhode island department of transportation has long @-@ term plans to upgrade the southernmost portion of route 4 to freeway status by constructing overpasses at oak hill road and west allenton road and a grade separation with us 1 . although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by 2007 , the $ 55 million project has been postponed indefinitely . \\n  = = route

grade intersection with a traffic signal after approximately 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) . the highway continues on a northwesterly projection , passing to the northeast of kettle hole pond and to the southwest of secret lake in a heavily forested region . after secret lake , the highway curves to the north , crossing oak hill road at another at @-@ grade intersection . \\n  shortly after the intersection with oak hill road , route 4 transitions from a divided arterial highway into a four @-@ lane limited @-@ access freeway . the freeway passes to the west of belleville pond and begins to parallel the alignment of route 102 ( ten rod road ) near the community of lafayette . route 4 passes over amtrak \\'s northeast corridor railroad before entering the business district of wickford junction . the freeway interchanges with routes 2 and 102 at exit 5 , a partial cloverleaf interchange . after the interchange , route 4 bends to the northeast , beginning a parallel alignment with route 2 that continues to its northern terminus . route 4 crosses into the town of east greenwich , passing under south road before interchanging with route 2 at exit 6 , a partial cloverleaf interchange . \\n  after exit 6 , route 4 passes the rhode island army national guard base to the east and to the hunt river to the west . route 4 northbound interchanges with route 403 at exit 7 ; route 403 , or the quonset freeway , is a four @-@ lane , limited access freeway and spur route of route 4 that serves the quonset business park and the village of davisville . heading southbound , exit 7 is split into exit 7b , which serves the quonset freeway , and exit 7a , which serves route 402 ( frenchtown road ) , another spur route connecting the highway to us 1 and route 2 . after exit 7 , route 4 continues northward as a six @-@ lane expressway , passing farmlands to the west and entering a suburban region of east greenwich . the highway crosses under an overpass at middle road before interchanging with route 401 , the freeway \\'s final spur , at another partial cloverleaf interchange . exit 8 is also used to access route 2 and i @-@ 95 south , which has no direct freeway connection with route 4 north . shortly after exit 8 , the route 4 designation ends and the mainline of the highway defaults onto i @-@ 95 north . \\n  = = history = = \\n  in 1950 , the rhode island general assembly passed a $ 12 million ( equivalent to $ 118 million in 2016 ) bond issue to fund the construction of a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , four @-@ lane divided arterial bypass of u.s. route 1 in wickford . construction on the highway began in 1952 and was completed in 1954 , at which time the roadway opened as an unnumbered state highway leading from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 in wickford . \\n  during the late 1950s , a few years after the completion of the arterial , the rhode island department of public works ( ridpw ) proposed a relocation of route 2 , which , at the time , was the major thoroughfare in the area . no action was taken until 1964 , when the ridpw introduced a study for the \" relocated route 2 \" proposal . during the study , drivers who used the colonel rodman highway arterial and were bound for the state capital of providence were redirected onto route 2 , an accident @-@ prone , four @-@ lane undivided highway near the modern exit 5 . in 1965 , the planned route 2 freeway was given the new number of route 4 , leaving route 2 on its existing alignment . a public hearing was held by the state of rhode island on the proposed freeway , which was to be four lanes and have a divided , grassy median . this proposal was later accepted , and construction began two years later . \\n  construction of a 5 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) long section of route 4 from what is now exit 6 in east greenwich to i @-@ 95 in warwick began in 1967 and was completed in 1972 . that year , the 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) arterial south of the modern exit 5 was also designated as part of route 4 . the divided highway remains largely intact to this date as the stretch of route 4 from us 1 to routes 2 and 102 at exit 5 ; the only piece of the arterial that has been significantly altered is the construction of a bridge over amtrak \\'s northeast corridor line . by the early 1970s , route 4 was complete north of exit 6 and south of what would become exit 5 , but there was a still a missing piece in the highway between the two exits . in the 1970s , the state of rhode island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns , both of which delayed the construction of the missing link for nearly eleven years . environmental studies on the missing link began in 1977 , and the state estimated that the 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) long section of freeway would cost $ 15 – 21 million ( equivalent to $ 59 – 82 million in 2016 ) to construct . \\n  in 1983 , the rhode island department of transportation ( ridot ) began construction of the new segment of route 4 between exits 5 and 6 . the project , which ultimately went over budget at $ 24 million ( equivalent to $ 52 million in 2016 ) ) , was financed from a $ 63 million federal grant . in 1986 , during excavation for the new right @-@ of @-@ way , the department of transportation found archeological items from the narragansett indians dating from about 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 500 years prior . although the findings were not centralized in the area , this caused delays for the extension of the freeway . on august 6 , 1988 , riodt completed construction and performed a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony for the new highway . \\n  in january 1990 , two police cruisers were severely damaged during a chase on route 4 . a driver was speeding in the southbound lanes of route 4 near exit 7 ; when the driver exited at route 402 ( frenchtown road ) , two police officers got into serious accidents in their attempts to pursue the vehicle . after the crashes , the american civil liberties union restarted efforts to amend police chase policy and avoid further crash @-@ related injuries for officers in the line of duty . \\n  in 2000 , construction began on the quonset freeway , a relocated route 403 that serves the quonset business park from route 4 . the project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit 7 off route 4 , which was a southbound @-@ only exit serving both route 403 and route 402 when constructed . the exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between route 4 , route 403 and route 402 and was completed in december 2008 , one year ahead of schedule . the project included the construction of a new northbound exit 7 serving route 403 east . \\n  = = future = = \\n  the rhode island department of transportation ( ridot ) has laid out long @-@ term plans for improvements to both the southern and northern termini of route 4 . during the 1980s and 1990s , ridot announced plans to eliminate the three traffic lights along the southern end of the highway . the department planned to replace the existing signalized us 1 and route 4 merge , converting it into a grade @-@ separated interchange with an extensive overpass . this would cut @-@ off access to three local roads that intersect us 1 near the signal . the plan also included the replacement of the two other signaled intersections at west allenton road and oak hill road with overpasses ; the overpass for west allenton road is planned to be constructed as a new exit 4 . in the 1990s , the state purchased and demolished several houses in the region to allow for an expanded route 4 right @-@ of @-@ way in the vicinity of west allenton road . \\n  the upgrade proposal proved to be very unpopular with north kingstown residents who lived on the affected local roads . additionally , ridot laid the highway out so that route 4 would cross through wetlands in the area . this sparked environmental concerns , as one of the large wetlands that would be affected , froberg \\'s marsh , was deemed to be of high value by rhode island environmentalists . despite local and environmental concerns , ridot still considers the route 4 upgrade to be the safest way to improve traffic flow in the region . while the department of transportation considered upgrading nearby route 2 to freeway standards as a potential alternative , this plan was ultimately rejected because of its effects on wells in the area . although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by 2007 , the $ 55 million project has been postponed indefinitely . \\n  ridot also has long @-@ range plans to construct direct freeway connections linking route 4 north with i @-@ 95 south and i @-@ 95 north with route 4 south . as of november 2010 , environmental studies are being

wilson , a very famous work on the history of revolutionary thought and socialism that tennant would have at least heard of , if not read , as a student . the bobby orlando @-@ produced version of the

girls \" was \" as catchy as anything on the radio in 1986 \" , praising \" its enticing bass line and foreboding synth riffs \" , but felt that it was almost \" nullified by peevish spoken asides and the cryptic posturing of the duo \\'s lyrics \" . in a review of the live album concrete , michael hubbard from musicomh said that \" west end girls \" was one of the songs that \" round out a collection that never feels too long or superfluous \" , adding that it \" goes some way to installing tennant and lowe as national treasures \" . \\n  nitsuh abebe from pitchfork media , in a review of their compilation album popart : pet shop boys - the hits commented that in the song \" we meet tennant not as a singer , but as a speaker \" , adding that \" he mumbles the verses to us not like a

first greatest hits album , greatest hits – chapter one , and its companion extended play , the smoakstack sessions vol . 2 . produced by greg kurstin , it is her first christmas album and her first record to be solely released by rca . wrapped in red consists of sixteen tracks , featuring five co @-@ penned original songs and eleven cover versions of christmas standards and carols , two of which are duets featuring recording artists ronnie dunn , reba mcentire and trisha yearwood . \\n  weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre , clarkson had long @-@ desired to record a christmas album as a means to defy genre limitations . she commissioned kurstin , who had studied jazz music under the tutelage of jaki byard , to produce the entire album . drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features a charlie brown christmas and white christmas , as well as the christmas albums by mariah carey , mcentire , and phil spector , they experimented on various styles and sounds using spector \\'s famed wall of sound technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics . the christmas music of wrapped in red comprises a variety of the genres such pop , jazz , country , and soul , marking a departure from the pop rock sound established from her previous studio albums ; while its lyrics share a singular theme of the color red , which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays . \\n  wrapped in red debuted on the billboard 200 chart at number 3 and topped the billboard top holiday albums chart with 70 @,@ 000 copies sold in its first week of release . for nine consecutive weeks , wrapped in red stayed on the top ten of both charts and was certified platinum by the recording industry association of america and music canada . by the end of 2013 , it became the year \\'s best @-@ selling christmas release in the united states and the second best @-@ selling christmas release in canada . its lead single \" underneath the tree \" became an international top forty christmas hit song and was radio \\'s most @-@ played new holiday song of 2013 . in promoting wrapped in red , she appeared in red dresses on various televised appearances ; and filmed an accompanying television special , kelly clarkson \\'s cautionary christmas music tale , at the venetian las vegas , which premiered on nbc on december 11 , 2013 . in 2014 , clarkson released the title track as the second single and hosted an annual christmas benefit concert , miracle on broadway , at the bridgestone arena on december 20 , 2014 . \\n  = = background = = \\n  clarkson had expressed interest in recording a christmas album for years , having recorded various christmas songs such as \" oh holy night \" and \" my grown up christmas list \" on the american idol : the great holiday classics ( 2003 ) , \" i \\'ll be home for christmas \" on itunes session ( 2011 ) , and being featured on blake shelton \\'s christmas album cheers , it \\'s christmas ( 2012 ) . weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre , she felt that recording a christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres . she remarked , \" i always get asked what genre i \\'m in : \\' is this country or pop or rock ? what are you ? \\' and what \\'s cool about making the christmas album was , \\' oh , there are no limitations ! we can do whatever we want ! \\' \" . she further added , \" the thing about christmas is that it almost doesn \\'t matter what mood you \\'re in or what kind of a year you \\'ve had — it \\'s a fresh start . i \\'m going to clear the air and take stock of the good that \\'s happened . \" \\n  discussions about making her sixth studio album being a christmas record began on december 2012 , a month after releasing her first greatest hits album , greatest hits – chapter one . having found the opportunity to do so , clarkson commissioned producer and multi @-@ instrumentalist greg kurstin , whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums stronger and chapter one , to solely produce the whole album . despite having been raised in a jewish faith and unfamiliar with christmas songs , kurstin still agreed to produce the project . as a result , the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer ( the first being david kahne solely producing my december in 2007 ) . it also marked the fourth time kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from being a member of the musical groups the bird and the bee and geggy tah ( the first three being lily allen \\'s it \\'s not me , it \\'s you in 2009 , sia \\'s we are born in 2010 , and the shins \\' port of morrow in 2012 ) . \\n  = = recording = = \\n  recording sessions of the basic instrumental tracks for wrapped in red took place in kurstin \\'s echo studio in los angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at eastwest studios in hollywood and featured vocals recorded in the barn studio in nashville . in recording tracks for the album , clarkson and kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh , contemporary sound to classic @-@ sounding music . he recalled , \" it was a lot of fun for us because we got to go back to our roots . when kelly started singing , it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything . \" further adding , \" we really experimented . it was so much fun and liberating . and it pays off . \" kurstin , who studied with jazz musician jaki byard at the new school for jazz and contemporary music , recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as james gadson , kevin dukes , roy mccurdy , and bill withers to perform on the record to resonate a memphis soul sound . he also collaborated with joseph trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra . \\n  in providing instrumentation for the record , kurstin used all of his instruments such as a mellotron and a chamberlin , taping them from a distance to stimulate the wall of sound , a recording technique originally developed by phil spector that was popular in the early 1960s . he enlisted clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself . clarkson , who grew up singing in a chorus , was pleased with the aspect ; saying , \" blending is something i knew how to do from childhood . sometimes i \\'d have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound . but i \\'ve never had to do anything like this before — doing all my backup vocals , essentially being my own choir . \" together , they began to record in may 2013 and continued through the summer of that year , beginning by recording \" white christmas \" with clarkson in the vocal booth and with kurstin on a piano . she commented , \" the production is all him . i would be just like \\' hey , can we make this more jazz ? hey , can we make this more bluesy . and he just , like harry potter , made this happen . it \\'s so weird . \" \\n  = = composition = = \\n  = = = theme and influences = = = \\n  clarkson has cited the color red as the album \\'s only theme . a color traditionally associated with christmas , she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays . wanting to stray away from her usual pop sound , she described wrapped in red \\'s music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz , country and memphis soul . she recalled , \" what \\'s cool about christmas albums is you can do jazz , rock and roll , you can do pop , you can do blues , like you can do all that stuff and it works — cause it \\'s all classic and it \\'s christmasy sounding . \" she also noted that the album \\'s multitude of styles positively contributes to her artistic goal , saying , \" my best friend from childhood heard it and said , \\' this is what you sound like , before everything else . \\' and i agree , it \\'s my core sound . back in the day , when artists came out with things like \" fall to pieces \" and \" bridge over troubled water \" , those songs transcended genres . it wasn \\'t , \\' where is it going to fit ? \\' you catered to whatever the song calls for . and that \\'s exactly what i did — without having to have an umbrella for everything . \" \\n  in gathering inspirations for wrapped in red , clarkson started by listening to bing crosby \\'s and rosemary clooney \\'s soundtracks from the 1954 feature film white christmas as well as mariah carey \\'s merry christmas ( 1994 ) and merry christmas to you ( 1997 ) by reba mcentire . while kurstin , who used to play in a jazz band , took influences from a charlie brown christmas by the vince guaraldi trio and a christmas gift for you by phil spector as his inspirations , which resulted to the album \\'s wall of sound resonance . clarkson also cited that her relationship with her then @-@ fiancé brandon blackstock had inspired some of the album \\'s lyrical content . \\n  = = = song analysis = = = \\n  clarkson shares writing credits on all five original songs on wrapped in red , some of which were written in december 2012 to avoid writing christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season . she co @-@ wrote the opening and the title track , \" wrapped in red \" , with ashley arrison , aben eubanks , and shane mcanally . a christmas ballad , the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film love actually ( 2003 ) , in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another . critics singled out the track the one that resonates the wall of sound the most . the second track , \" underneath the tree \" , was written by clarkson and kurstin , making it the first time they had co @-@ written a track together . clarkson remarked , \" greg and i have worked a lot together , but usually i just come in and i just sing . we \\'ve never have actually written a song together at this point . and he and i were like , \\' let \\'s just try to write something for the record . \" rca records chief executive peter edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of \" all i want for christmas is you \" by carey . the following track is a rendition of the holiday standard \" have yourself a merry little christmas \" , which clarkson had selected for its saccharine content . \\n  clarkson favored \" run run rudolph \" as her favorite classic , saying \" just because it got to be a little more rock and roll . \" she also remarked that \" please come home for christmas ( bells will be ringing ) \" , was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother \\'s recommendation and the song \\'s melancholic lyrics . written by clarkson and eubanks , \" every christmas \" , was the first song to be written for the album . she revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting blackstock , mcentire \\'s stepson , saying \" every christmas , i was just like , \\' this is going to be different , right ? i \\'m going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life ? \\' \" . the seventh track is a cover of elvis presley \\'s \" blue christmas \" . its follow @-@ up , a rendition of \" baby , it \\'s cold outside \" , features ronnie dunn . clarkson had approached dunn thinking that his personality suited the song \\'s content well , saying \" like , it \\'s straight @-@ up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay , and have a drink . \" \" winter dreams ( brandon \\'s song ) \" was written by clarkson , arrison , and eubanks as a companion piece to \" every christmas \" . dedicated to blackstock , the song accounts her holiday after meeting him . she remarked , \" christmas changes , it morphs , it comes to life a little more … it ’ s just a happier time . \" \\n  the tenth track , \" white christmas \" , was the first song to be recorded for wrapped in red . a cover of rodgers and hammerstein \\'s \" my favorite things \" follows up as the eleventh track . clarkson opted for the broadway performance of the song to stray away from julie andrews \\'s version , citing \" i think you shouldn \\'t go near anywhere of what she \\'s doing because she \\'s so good . \" clarkson and kurstin co @-@ wrote \" 4 carats \" with cathy dennis and livvi franc . originally written a pop song , they converted it as a christmas song to fit the album \\'s theme , describing it as a crossover between eartha kitt \\'s \" santa baby \" ( 1953 ) and madonna \\'s \" material girl \" ( 1984 ) . a rendition of imogen heap \\'s \" just for now \" was described by clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment , saying \" can we just stop for like five minutes and have like a normal christmas setting ? \" the song begins by sampling the melody of the christmas tune \" carol of the bells \" . the closing track , a rendition of the traditional carol \" silent night \" , features mcentire and trisha yearwood and ends in an a capella setting between the trio . in addition , two tracks were also included in the deluxe edition of the album : the first , clarkson \\'s cover of \" i \\'ll be home for christmas \" from itunes session ; and the second , her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn \" oh come , oh come emmanuel \" . \\n  = = release = = \\n  wrapped in red was first released

atlantic canada . it developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast gulf of mexico near the florida keys , and moved across the state of florida . as it entered the warm waters of the gulf stream in the atlantic ocean , it began to rapidly intensify , exhibiting traits of a tropical system , including the formation of an eye . it attained a pressure of 970 millibars on december 23 and 24 , and after moving northward , it came ashore near new york city on christmas eve . because of the uncertain nature of the storm , the national hurricane center ( nhc ) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone . \\n  heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in south carolina . much of the rest of the east coast was affected by high winds , coastal flooding , and beach erosion . new york state and new england bore the brunt of the storm ; damage was extensive on long island , and in connecticut , 130 @,@ 000 households lost electric power during the storm . widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout rhode island and massachusetts , where the storm generated 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) waves along the coast . because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm \\'s development , precipitation was limited to rain . two people were killed , and damage amounted to at least $ 21 million . \\n  = = meteorological history = = \\n  the storm originated in an upper @-@ level low pressure system that moved southeastward from the central great plains into the deep south of the united states . after reaching the southeast gulf of mexico , the disturbance underwent cyclogenesis , and the resultant system moved through florida on december 22 in response to an approaching trough . national hurricane center forecaster jack beven noted that \" as it moved out into the bahamas , it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm . \" the uncertain nature of the storm prevented the nhc from issuing advisories on it , and forecasters lacked sufficient data to fully assess the cyclone for potential tropical characteristics . the same trough that pushed the storm across florida had moved to the north , allowing for high pressure to develop in the upper levels of the atmosphere . \\n  deemed a \" hybrid storm \" , the cyclone rapidly intensified in warm waters of up to 80 ° f ( 27 ° c ) from the gulf stream combined with a cold air mass over the united states . the system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the gulf stream ; it developed central convection , an unusual trait for an extratropical cyclone , and at one point exhibited an eye . despite these indications of tropical characteristics , \" there was no front associated with it and it had a warm core , but the radius of maximum winds was more than 150 nautical miles ( 170 mi ; 280 km ) , so under the standard nhc criteria it didn \\'t qualify as a tropical storm . \" on december 23 and 24 , the nor \\'easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of 970 mb ( 29 inhg ) . an upper @-@ level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance . in an interaction known as the fujiwhara effect , the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor \\'easter northwestward towards southern new york and new england . the original low passed along the south shore of long island , and made landfall near new york city on december 24 . subsequently , it moved over southeastern new york state . on december 25 , the system began to rapidly weaken as it moved towards nova scotia , before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea in tandem in the early hours of december 26 . \\n  = = effects = = \\n  = = = southeast united states = = = \\n  in south carolina , flooding associated with the cyclone was considered to be the worst since 1943 . over 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of rainfall was reported , while winds brought down trees and ripped awnings . in addition , the coast suffered the effects of beach erosion . thousands of electric customers in the state lost power . as a result of the heavy rainfall , several dams became overwhelmed by rising waters . extensive flooding of roads and highways was reported , many of which were closed as a result . up to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) of water flooded some homes in the region . approximately 300 people in florence county were forced to evacuate because of the flooding , and at least 200 homes were damaged . two deaths were reported in the state . one woman was killed when her vehicle hydroplaned and struck a tree , and another person drowned after her car was struck by another vehicle . total damage in south carolina amounted to at least $ 4 million . \\n  strong winds occurred along the north carolina coast . diamond shoals reported sustained winds of 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) , and offshore , winds gusted to 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . on wrightsville beach , rough surf eroded an 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) ledge into the beach . on carolina beach , dunes were breached and some roads , including portions of north carolina highway 12 , were closed . \\n  = = = mid @-@ atlantic = = = \\n  as the primary storm entered new england , the secondary low produced minor coastal flooding in the tidewater region of virginia on december 23 . winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour ( 56 to 72 km / h ) and tides to 1 to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal were reported . in sandbridge , virginia beach , virginia , a beachfront home collapsed into the sea . several roads throughout the region suffered minor flooding . strong winds resulting from the tight pressure gradient between the nor \\'easter and an area of high pressure located over the united states brought down a few utility poles , which sparked a brush fire on december 24 . the fire , quickly spread by the wind , burned a field . the winds brought down several trees . \\n  damage was light in maryland . some sand dunes and wooden structures were damaged , and above @-@ normal tides occurred . in new jersey , high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines . minor coastal flooding of streets and houses was reported . otherwise , damage in the state was minor . \\n  the storm brought heavy rainfall and high winds to new york state and new york city on december 23 and 24 . gusts of 60 to 80 miles per hour ( 97 to 129 km / h ) downed hundreds of trees and many power lines on long island . several homes , in addition to many cars , sustained damage . roughly 112 @,@ 000 long island lighting company customers experienced power outages at some point during the storm . as the cyclone progressed northward into new york state , high winds occurred in the hudson valley region . throughout columbia , ulster and rensselaer counties , trees , tree limbs , and power lines were downed by the winds . at stephentown , a gust of 58 miles per hour ( 93 km / h ) was reported . ulster county suffered substantial impacts , with large trees being uprooted and striking homes . across eastern new york

northeast and later from the east . trees , tree limbs , and power lines were downed , causing damage to property and vehicles . the high winds caused widespread power outages , affecting up to 130 @,@ 000 electric customers . as a result , electric companies sought help from as far as pennsylvania and maine to restore electricity . bruno ranniello , a spokesman for northeast utilities , reported that \" we \\'ve had outages in virtually every community . \" in new haven , the nor \\'easter ripped three barges from their moorings . one of the barges traveled across the long island sound and ran aground near port jefferson , new york . a man in milford was killed indirectly when a tree that was partially downed by the storm fell on him during an attempt to remove it from a relative \\'s yard . northeast utilities , which reported the majority of the power outages , estimated storm damage in the state to be about $ 6 – $ 8 million ( 1994 usd ; $ 8 @.@ 8 – $ 11 @.@ 8 million 2008 usd ) . \\n  effects were less severe in new hampshire and vermont . in southern new hampshire , a line of thunderstorms produced torrential rainfall , causing flooding on parts of new hampshire route 13 . flash flooding of several tributaries feeding into the piscataquog river was reported . in maine , the storm brought high winds and heavy rain . along the coast of southern maine and new hampshire , beach erosion was reported . additionally , minor flooding was reported across the region , as a result of heavy surface runoff and small ice jams . in rhode island , the power outages were the worst since hurricane bob of the 1991 atlantic hurricane season . throughout the state , approximately 40 @,@ 000 customers were without electric power . as with massachusetts , downed trees and property damage were widespread . there were many reports of roof shingles being blown off roofs and of damage to gutters . in warwick , several small boats were damaged after being knocked into other boats . the highest reported wind gust in the state was 74 miles per hour ( 119 km / h ) at ashaway , rhode island . statewide damage totaled about $ 5 million . \\n  massachusetts , particularly cape cod and nantucket , bore the brunt of the nor \\'easter . reportedly , wind gusts approached 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) on cape cod and , offshore , waves reached 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . at walpole , wind gusts peaked at 88 miles per hour ( 142 km / h ) , while on nantucket gusts of 84 miles per hour ( 135 km / h ) were reported . the winds left 30 @,@ 000 electric customers without power during the storm , primarily in the eastern part of the state . power was out for some as long as 48 hours . property damage was widespread and many trees , signs , and billboards were blown down . a large tent used by the new england patriots was ripped and blown off its foundation . the winds also spread a deadly house fire in north attleboro . although not directly related to the storm , it caused seven fatalities . because tides were low , little coastal flooding occurred . outside the prudential tower center in boston , the storm toppled a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) christmas tree . rainfall of 2 to 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 51 to 89 mm ) was recorded throughout the eastern part of the state , contributing to heavy runoff that washed away a 400 @-@ foot ( 120 m ) section of a highway . total damage in massachusetts was estimated at about $ 5 million . \\n  = sholay = \\n  sholay ( pronunciation , meaning \" embers \" ) is a 1975 indian hindi @-@ language action @-@ adventure film directed by ramesh sippy and produced by his father g. p. sippy . the film follows two criminals , veeru and jai ( played by dharmendra and amitabh bachchan ) , hired by a retired police officer ( sanjeev kumar ) to capture the ruthless dacoit gabbar singh ( amjad khan ) . hema malini and jaya bhaduri also star , as veeru and jai \\'s love interests . sholay is considered a classic and one of the best indian films . it was ranked first in the british film institute \\'s 2002 poll of \" top 10 indian films \" of all time . in 2005 , the judges of the 50th annual filmfare awards named it the best film of 50 years . \\n  the film was shot in the rocky terrain of ramanagara , in the southern state of karnataka , over a span of two and a half years . after the central board of film certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes , sholay was released with a length of 198 minutes . in 1990 , the original director \\'s cut of 204 minutes became available on home media . when first released , sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response , but favourable word @-@ of @-@ mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success . it broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across india , and ran for more than five years at mumbai \\'s minerva theatre . by some accounts , sholay is the highest grossing indian film of all time , adjusted for inflation . \\n  the film drew heavily from the conventions of westerns , and is a defining example of the masala film , which mixes several genres in one work . scholars have noted several themes in the film , such as glorification of violence , conformation to feudal ethos , debate between social order and mobilised usurpers , homosocial bonding , and the film \\'s role as a national allegory . the combined sales of the original soundtrack , scored by r. d. burman , and the dialogues ( released separately ) , set new sales records . the film \\'s dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular , contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of india \\'s daily vernacular . in january 2014 , sholay was re @-@ released to theatres in the 3d format . \\n  = = plot = = \\n  in the small village of ramgarh , the retired policeman thakur baldev singh ( sanjeev kumar ) summons a pair of small @-@ time thieves that he had once arrested . thakur feels that the duo — veeru ( dharmendra ) and jai ( amitabh bachchan ) — would be ideal to help him capture gabbar singh ( amjad khan ) , a dacoit wanted by the authorities for a ₹ 50 @,@ 000 reward . thakur tells them to surrender gabbar to him , alive , for an additional ₹ 20 @,@ 000 reward . \\n  the two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by gabbar to extort the villagers . soon afterwards , gabbar and his goons attack ramgarh during the festival of holi . in a tough battle , veeru and jai are cornered . thakur , although he has a gun within his reach , does not help them . veeru and jai fight back and the bandits flee . the two are , however , upset at thakur \\'s inaction , and consider leaving the village . thakur explains that gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members , and cut off both his arms a few years earlier , which is why he could not use the gun . he had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl . \\n  living in ramgarh , the jovial veeru and cynical jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers . veeru is attracted to basanti ( hema malini ) , a feisty , talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse @-@ cart . jai is drawn to radha ( jaya bhaduri ) , thakur \\'s reclusive , widowed daughter @-@ in @-@ law , who subtly returns his affections . \\n  skirmishes between gabbar \\'s gang and jai @-@ veeru finally result in the capture of veeru and basanti by the dacoits . jai attacks the gang , and the three are able to flee gabbar \\'s hideout with dacoits in pursuit . fighting from behind a rock , jai and veeru nearly run out of ammunition . veeru , unaware that jai was wounded in the gunfight , is forced to leave for more ammunition . meanwhile , jai , who is continuing the gunfight singlehandedly , decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range . \\n  veeru returns , and jai dies in his arms . enraged , veeru attacks gabbar \\'s den and catches the dacoit . veeru nearly beats gabbar to death when thakur appears and reminds veeru of the promise to hand over gabbar alive . thakur uses his spike @-@ soled shoes to severely injure gabbar and destroy his hands . the police then arrive and arrest gabbar . after jai \\'s funeral , veeru leaves ramgarh and finds basanti waiting for him on the train . radha is left

line snippet which screenwriter pair salim @-@ javed told g. p. sippy and ramesh sippy ; two other producer / director teams had earlier rejected the idea . ramesh sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it . the original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex @-@ soldiers to avenge the murder of his family . the army officer was later changed to a policeman because sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities . salim @-@ javed completed the script in one month , incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances . \\n  the film was loosely styled after akira kurosawa \\'s 1954 film seven samurai , and drew heavily from the conventions of westerns , especially sergio leone \\'s spaghetti westerns such as once upon a time in the west ( 1968 ) , and john sturges \\' film the magnificent seven ( 1960 ) . sholay was also influenced by the westerns of sam peckinpah , such as the wild bunch ( 1969 ) and pat garrett and billy the kid ( 1973 ) ; and by george roy hill \\'s butch cassidy and the sundance kid ( 1969 ) . a scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in north west frontier ( 1959 ) , and a scene showing the massacre of thakur \\'s family has been compared with the massacre of the mcbain family in once upon a time in the west . some plot elements were borrowed from the indian films mera gaon mera desh ( 1971 ) and khote sikkay ( 1973 ) . \\n  the character gabbar singh was modelled on a real @-@ life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around gwalior in the 1950s . any policeman captured by the real gabbar singh had his ears and nose cut off , and was released as a warning to other policemen . the character was also influenced by the villain \" el indio \" ( played by gian maria volontè ) of sergio leone \\'s for a few dollars more ( 1965 ) . soorma bhopali , a minor comic relief character , was based on an acquaintance of actor jagdeep , a forest officer from bhopal named soorma . the real @-@ life soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter . the main characters \\' names , jai and veeru , mean \" victory \" and \" heroism \" in hindi . \\n  = = = casting = = = \\n  the producers considered danny denzongpa for the role of bandit chief gabbar singh , but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in feroz khan \\'s dharmatma ( 1975 ) , under production at the same time . amjad khan , who was the second choice , prepared himself for the part by reading the book abhishapta chambal , which told of the exploits of chambal dacoits . the book was written by taroon kumar bhaduri , the father of fellow cast member jaya bhaduri . as cast members had read the script ahead of time , many were interested in playing different parts . pran was considered for the role of thakur baldev singh , but sippy thought sanjeev kumar was a better choice . initially , dharmendra was also interested to play the role of thakur . he eventually gave up the role when sippy informed him that sanjeev kumar would play veeru if that happened , and would be paired with hema malini , who dharmendra was trying to woo . dharmendra knew that kumar was also interested in malini . sippy wanted shatrughan sinha to play the part of jai , but there were already several big stars signed , and amitabh bachchan , who was not extremely popular yet , lobbied hard to get the part for himself . \\n  during the film \\'s production , four of the leads became romantically involved . bachchan married bhaduri four months before filming started . this led to shooting delays when bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter shweta . by the time of the film \\'s release , she was pregnant with their son abhishek . dharmendra had begun wooing malini during their earlier film seeta aur geeta ( 1972 ) , and used the location shoot of sholay to further pursue her . during their romantic scenes , dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot , thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him to spend more time with her . the couple married five years after the film \\'s release . \\n  = = = filming = = = \\n  much of sholay was shot in the rocky terrain of ramanagara , a town near bangalore , karnataka . the filmmakers had to build a road from the bangalore highway to ramanagara for convenient access to the sets . art director ram yedekar had an entire township built on the site . a prison set was constructed near rajkamal studio in mumbai , also outdoors , to match the natural lighting of the on @-@ location sets . one part of ramanagara was for a time called \" sippy nagar \" as a tribute to the director of the film . as of 2010 , a visit to the \" sholay rocks \" ( where much the film was shot ) was still being offered to tourists travelling through ramanagara . \\n  filming began on location on 3 october 1973 , with a scene featuring bachchan and bhaduri . the film had a lavish production for its time ( with frequent banquets and parties for the cast ) , took two and a half years to make , and went over budget . one reason for its high cost was that sippy re @-@ filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect . \" yeh dosti \" , a 5 @-@ minute song sequence , took 21 days to shoot , two short scenes in which radha lights lamps took 20 days to film because of lighting problems , and the shooting of the scene in which gabbar kills the imam \\'s son lasted 19 days . the train robbery sequence , shot on the mumbai – pune railway route near panvel , took more than 7 weeks to complete . \\n  sholay was the first indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the 70 mm widescreen format . however , since actual 70 mm cameras were expensive at the time , the film was shot on traditional 35 mm film and the 4 : 3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2 @.@ 2 : 1 frame . regarding the process , sippy said , \" a 70mm [ sic ] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger , but since i also wanted a spread of sound we used six @-@ track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen . it was definitely a differentiator . \" the use of 70 mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the cinemascope logo . film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before ; one of them added the tagline : \" the greatest star cast ever assembled – the greatest story ever told \" . \\n  = = = alternate version = = = \\n  the director \\'s original cut of sholay has a different ending in which thakur kills gabbar , along with some additional violent scenes . gabbar \\'s death scene , and the scene in which the imam \\'s son is killed , were cut from the film by india \\'s censor board , as was the scene in which thakur \\'s family is massacred . the censor board was concerned about the violence , and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely . although sippy fought to keep the scenes , eventually he had to re @-@ shoot the ending of the film , and as directed by the censor board , have the police arrive just before thakur can kill gabbar . the censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years . the original , unedited cut of the film finally came out in a british release on vhs in 1990 . since then , eros international has released two versions on dvd . the director \\'s cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204 minutes in length ; the censored widescreen version is 198 minutes long . \\n  = = themes = = \\n  scholars have noted several themes in the film , such as glorification of violence , conformation to feudal ethos , debate between social order and mobilised usurpers , homosocial bonding , and the film \\'s role as a national allegory . \\n  koushik banerjea , a sociologist in the london school of economics , notes that sholay exhibits a \" sympathetic construction of \\' rogue \\' masculinity \" exemplified by the likeable outlaws jai and veeru . banerjea argues during the film , the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes . film scholar wimal dissanayake agrees that the film brought \" a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order \" to indian cinema . film scholar m. madhava prasad states that jai and veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society . prasad says that , through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of jai and veeru \\'s criminality for the greater good , the narrative reflects reactionary politics , and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order . banerjea explains that though jai and veeru are mercenaries , they are humanised by their emotional needs . such dualism makes them vulnerable , in contrast to the pure evil of gabbar singh . \\n  gabbar singh , the film \\'s antagonist , was well received by the audience , despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty . dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character , and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions , a first for indian melodrama . he notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited . he further notes that , unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience \\'s attention as an object of male fetish , in sholay , the male body becomes the centrepiece . it becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy . dissanayake argues that sholay can be viewed as a national allegory : it lacks a comforting logical narrative , it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged , and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions . taken together , these elements comprise the allegorical representation of india . the narrative style of sholay , with its violence , revenge , and vigilante action , is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in india at the time of its release . this tension culminated in the emergency ( rule by decree ) declared by prime minister indira gandhi in 1975 . \\n  dissanayeke and sahai note that , although the film borrowed heavily from the hollywood western genre , particularly in its visuals , it was successfully \" indianised \" . as an example , william van der heide has compared a massacre scene in sholay with a similar scene in once upon a time in the west . although both films were similar in technical style , sholay emphasised indian family values and melodramatic tradition , while the western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach . maithili rao , in encyclopedia of hindi cinema , notes that sholay infuses the style of the western genre into a \" feudalistic ethos \" . ted shen of the chicago reader notes sholay \\'s \" hysterical visual style \" and intermittent \" populist message \" . cultural critic and islamist scholar ziauddin sardar lampoons the film in his book the secret politics of our desires : innocence , culpability and indian popular cinema , both for its caricature and stereotyping of muslim and women characters , and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers . sardar notes that the two most prominent muslim characters in the film are soorma bhopali ( a buffoonish criminal ) , and an impotent victim of the bandits ( the imam ) . meanwhile , the sole function of one female character ( radha ) is to suffer her fate in silence , while the other female lead ( basanti ) is just a garrulous village belle . \\n  some scholars have indicated that sholay contains homosocial themes . ted shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style . dina holtzman , in her book bollywood and globalization : indian popular cinema , nation , and diaspora , states that the death of jai , and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads , is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship ( that of veeru and basanti ) . \\n  = = music = = \\n  r. d. burman composed the film \\'s music , and the lyrics were written by anand bakshi . the songs used in the film , and released on the original soundtrack are listed below . following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack . the album \\'s cover image depicts an emotional scene from the film in which basanti is forced to sing and dance on the song \" haa jab tak hai jaan \" on broken glass under the blazing sun to save veeru \\'s life . \\n  the song \" mehbooba mehbooba \" was sung by its composer , r. d. burman , who received his sole filmfare award nomination for playback singing for his effort . the song , which is often featured on bollywood hit song compilations , samples \" say you love me \" by greek singer demis roussos . \" mehbooba mehbooba \" has

it was also remixed and sung by himesh reshammiya , along with bhosle , in his debut acting film aap kaa surroor ( 2007 ) . \" yeh dosti \" has been called the ultimate friendship anthem . it was remixed and sung by shankar mahadevan and udit narayan for the 2010 malayalam film four friends , and also in 2010 it was used to symbolise india \\'s friendship with the united states during a visit from president barack obama . \\n  several songs from the soundtrack were included in the annual binaca geetmala list of top filmi songs . \" mehbooba mehooba \" was listed at no. 24 on the 1975 list , and at no. 6 on the 1976 list . \" koi haseena \" was listed at no. 30 in 1975 , and no. 20 in 1976 . \" yeh dosti \" was listed at no. 9 in 1976 . despite the soundtrack \\'s success , at the time , the songs from sholay attracted less attention than the film \\'s dialogue — a rarity for bollywood . the producers were thus prompted to release records with only dialogue . taken together , the album sales totalled an unprecedented 500 @,@ 000 units , and became one of the top selling bollywood soundtracks of the 1970s . \\n  music critic oli marlow reviewed the soundtrack in 2013 , calling it a unique fusion of religious , folk , and classical music , with influences from around the world . he also commented on the sound design of the film , calling it psychedelic , and saying that there was \" a lot of incredible incidental music \" in the film that was not included in the soundtrack releases . in a 1999 paper submitted to london \\'s symposium on sound in cinema , film critic shoma a. chatterji said , \" sholay offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes . sholay is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time , without breaking the continuity of the narrative , yet , intensifying the drama . \" \\n  = = reception = = \\n  = = = box office = = = \\n  sholay was released on 15 august 1975 , indian independence day , in mumbai . due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools , it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks . from the third week , however , viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth . during the initial slow period , the director and writer considered re @-@ shooting some scenes so that amitabh bachchan \\'s character would not die . when business picked up , they abandoned this idea . after being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets , sholay soon became an \" overnight sensation \" . the film was then released in other distribution zones such as delhi , uttar pradesh , bengal , and hyderabad on 11 october 1975 . it became the highest grossing bollywood film of 1975 , and film ranking website box office india has given the film a verdict of \" all time blockbuster \" . \\n  sholay went on to earn a still @-@ standing record of 60 golden jubilees across india , and was the first film in india to celebrate a silver jubilee at over 100 theatres . it was shown continuously at mumbai \\'s minerva theatre for over five years . sholay was the indian film with the longest theatrical run until dilwale dulhania le jayenge ( 1995 ) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001 . \\n  exact figures are not available on the budget and box office earnings of sholay , but film trade websites provide estimates of its success . according to box office india , sholay earned about ₹ 150 million nett gross ( valued at about us $ 16 @,@ 778 @,@ 000 in 1975 ) in india during its first run , which was many times its ₹ 30 million ( valued at about us $ 3 @,@ 355 @,@ 000 in 1975 ) budget . those earnings were a record that remained unbroken for nineteen years , which is also the longest amount of time that a film has held the record . its original gross was increased further with re @-@ releases during the late 1970s , 1980s , 1990s , and early 2000s . it is often cited that after adjusting the figures for inflation , sholay is one of the highest grossing films in the history of indian cinema , although such figures are not known with certainty . in 2012 , box office india gave ₹ 1 @.@ 63 billion ( us $ 24 million ) as sholay \\'s adjusted net gross , whereas times of india , in a 2009 report of business of indian films , reported over ₹ 3 billion ( us $ 45 million ) as the adjusted gross . \\n  = = = critical response = = = \\n  initial critical reviews of sholay were negative . among contemporary critics , k.l. amladi of india today called the film a \" dead ember \" and \" a gravely flawed attempt \" . filmfare said that the film was an unsuccessful mincing of western style with indian milieu , making it an \" imitation western — neither here nor there . \" others labelled it as \" sound and fury signifying nothing \" and a \" second @-@ rate take @-@ off \" of the 1971 film mera gaon mera desh . trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop . in a 1976 article in the journal studies : an irish quarterly review , author michael gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film , but otherwise criticised it stating , \" as a spectacle it breaks new ground , but on every other level it is intolerable : formless , incoherent , superficial in human image , and a somewhat nasty piece of violence \" . \\n  over time , the critical reception to sholay greatly improved ; it is now considered a classic , and among the greatest hindi @-@ language films . in a 2005 bbc review , the well @-@ rounded characters and simple narrative of the film were commended , but the comical cameos of asrani and jagdeep were considered unnecessary . on the film \\'s 35th anniversary , the hindustan times wrote that it was a \" trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music , \" and that \" practically every scene , dialogue or even a small character was a highlight . \" in 2006 , the film society of lincoln center described sholay as \" an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure , comedy , music and dance \" , labelling it an \" indisputable classic \" . chicago review critic ted shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and \" slapdash \" cinematography , and noted that the film \" alternates between slapstick and melodrama \" . in their obituary of the producer g.p. sippy , the new york times said that sholay \" revolutionized hindi filmmaking and brought true professionalism to indian script writing \" . \\n  = = = awards = = = \\n  sholay was nominated for nine filmfare awards , but the only winner was m. s. shinde , who won the award for best editing . the film also won three awards at the 1976 bengal film journalists \\' association awards ( hindi section ) : \" best actor in supporting role \" for amjad khan , \" best cinematographer ( colour ) \" for dwarka divecha , and \" best art director \" for ram yedekar . sholay received a special award at the 50th filmfare awards in 2005 : best film of 50 years . \\n  = = legacy = = \\n  sholay has received many \" best film \" honours . it was declared the \" film of the millennium \" by bbc india in 1999 . it topped the british film institute \\'s \" top 10 indian films \" of all time poll of 2002 , and was voted the greatest indian movie in a sky digital poll of one million british indians in 2004 . it was also included in time magazine \\'s \" best of bollywood \" list in 2010 , and in cnn @-@ ibn \\'s list of the \" 100 greatest indian films of all time \" in 2013 . \\n  sholay inspired many films and pastiches , and spawned a subgenre of films , the \" curry western \" , which is a play on the term spaghetti western . it was an early and most definitive masala film , and a trend @-@ setter for \" multi @-@ star \" films . the film was a watershed for bollywood \\'s scriptwriters , who were not paid well before sholay ; after the film \\'s success , script writing became a more respected profession . \\n  certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in india , such as \" kitne aadmi the \" ( how many men were there ? ) , \" jo dar gaya , samjho mar gaya \" ( one who is scared is dead ) , and \" bahut yaarana laagta hai \" ( looks like you two are very close ) – all dialogues of gabbar singh . these and other popular dialogues entered the people \\'s daily vernacular . characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture . gabbar singh , the sadistic villain , ushered in an era in hindi films characterised by \" seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains \" , who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story , such as shakal ( played by kulbhushan kharbanda ) of shaan ( 1980 ) , mogambo ( amrish puri ) of mr. india ( 1987 ) and bhujang ( amrish puri ) of tridev ( 1989 ) . filmfare , in 2013 , named gabbar singh the most iconic villain in the history of indian cinema , and four actors were included in its 2010 list of \" 80 iconic performances \" for their work in this film . \\n  the film is often credited with making amitabh bachchan a \" superstar \" , two years after he became a star with zanjeer ( 1973 ) . some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in sholay ; for example , mac mohan continued to be referred to as \" sambha \" , even though his character had just one line . major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials , promos , films and sitcoms . amjad khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career . he also played gabbar singh again in the 1991 spoof ramgarh ke sholay , and reprised the role in commercials . the british film institute in 2002 wrote that fear of gabbar singh \" is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep \" . the 2012 film gabbar singh , named after the character , became the highest grossing telugu film up to that point . comedian jagdeep , who played soorma bhopali in the film , attempted to use his sholay success to create a spinoff . he directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film soorma bhopali , in which dharmendra and bachchan had cameos . \\n  in 2004 , sholay was digitally remastered and shown again to packed theatres in india , including mumbai \\'s minerva , where it had run successfully 29 years earlier . an attempt to remake sholay , ram gopal varma \\'s film aag ( 2007 ) , starring amitabh bachchan as the villain , was a commercial and critical disaster . because of television and home media , sholay is widely available and still popular . twenty years after its release , sholay was first shown on the indian dd national television channel , where it drew the highest ratings ever for a film broadcast . video game producer mobile2win released the \" sholay ramgarh express \" game for mobile phones in 2004 , along with other sholay themed content such as wallpapers , video clips , and ringtones . \\n  sholay has been the subject of two books and many articles . wimal dissanayake and malti sahai \\'s sholay , a cultural reading ( 1992 ) attempts a comprehensive scholarly study that sets the film within the broader history of popular cinema in india . anupama chopra \\'s sholay : the making of a classic ( 2000 ) provides an inside look at the film \\'s production based on interviews with the director , stars , and crew members . \\n  sholay has been labelled by chopra as the gold standard in indian cinema , and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts . over the years , the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture , and has been called the greatest hindi film of all time . it belongs to only a small collection of films , including kismet ( 1943 ) , mother india ( 1957 ) , mughal @-@ e @-@ azam ( 1960 ) and hum aapke hain koun .. ! ( 1994 ) , which are repeatedly watched throughout india , and are viewed as definitive hindi films with cultural significance . the lasting effect of sholay on indian cinema was summarised by anupama chopra , when in 2004 she called it \" no longer just a film , [ but ] an event \" . in the 2000 book sholay : the making of a classic , the noted director shekhar kapur stated \" there has never been a more defining film on the indian screen . indian film history can be divided into sholay bc and sholay ad \" . the film was jointly released in pakistan by geo films and mandviwalla entertainment on

grandson of producer g. p. sippy , said that he would sponsor a conversion of the film to 3d , and release it in late 2012 ; this was later postponed to late 2013 , and eventually finalised for 3 january 2014 . it took ₹ 250 million ( us $ 3 @.@ 7 million ) to convert sholay to 3d . \\n  under the leadership of computer animator frank foster , 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3d format , for which every scene had to be individually restored , colour @-@ corrected and re @-@ composited in 3d to match the depth . new set @-@ pieces , particularly those suited to the new format were also included , such as digital logs which scatter in the direction of the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them , the gunshot scene which frees jai and veeru from their handcuffs , and panoramic views of gabbar \\'s hideout in the caves . \\n  the theatrical trailer and release date were unveiled by the original script @-@ writers salim khan and javed akhtar . the two original leads , bachchan and dharmendra , were also involved in promoting the re @-@ release . the film was released in 1 @,@ 000 screens in india , and additional screens

the cabinet had approved over half a billion baht worth of funding for a 14 @,@ 000 @-@ man secret anti @-@ protest special operations force , of which general saprang was commander . the so @-@ called cns special operations center , funded with 556 million baht diverted from the defense ministry , police office , and government emergency reserve fund , had been secretly established by the cns on 1 december 2006 in order to control protests . \\n  = = = tot and cat telecom = = = \\n  saprang was appointed by the junta to become chairman of the board of directors of airports of thailand ( aot ) and also chairman of the boards of tot and cat telecom , two major state @-@ owned telecommunication companies . saprang \\'s first move as tot chairman was to hand @-@ pick three army colonels and vocal thaksin @-@ critic vuthiphong priebjrivat to sit on the state enterprise \\'s board of directors . saprang transferred tot president somkuan bruminhent to an inactive position and appointed vuthiphong new president . he then hand @-@ picked all 10 other directors . \\n  saprang noted in an interview that , \" if telecommunication businesses are in private hands , the country won \\'t be safe . \" the junta had earlier announced plans to cancel the initial public offering of both tot and cat telecom and to merge the two state enterprises . \\n  under saprang \\'s leadership , tot reaffirmed its ownership rights to all existing backbone telecommunications networks under a new strategy to act as a \" genuine \" national telecom company . the new strategy was expected to increase political and business tensions . under the build @-@ transfer @-@ operate ( bto ) concession agreements that tot signed with private telecom operators , the tot technically owns all fixed @-@ line , mobile , and optical fibre networks in thailand . however , it had never exercised those rights in the past . \\n  vuthiphong was fired from the tot board and his position of acting tot president in june 2007 . he immediately accused the army of using the tot as an unmonitored slush fund . he claimed that an unnamed army unit had requested that tot buy it 800 million baht worth of electronic equipment . upon receiving the request , vuthipong demanded to know why neither the army nor the defence ministry used their own secret budgets to purchase the equipment , and why an internal army unit , rather than the kingdom \\'s main national security organisations , had made the request . saprang denied that there was any lack of transparency in the request for financial support . vuthipong claimed that the equipment should only have cost 30 million baht , not 800 million baht . he was fired and expelled from the board soon after refusing to sign off on the deal . the board later appointed col. natee sukolrat as the new tot president and accepted the army \\'s donation request . \\n  under his leadership , tot \\'s performance dropped . revenues for the first half of 2007 fell 13 % year @-@ on @-@ year , while net profit fell 36 @.@ 1 % . fixed line revenue dropped 16 % , while public telephone and international call revenue by 30 % each . \\n  as chairman of cat telecom , saprang was accused by the founders of people \\'s television ( ptv ) , a new satellite television station , of being behind cat telecom \\'s refusal to grant an internet link from bangkok to a satellite up @-@ link station in hong kong . ptv was established by several ex @-@ executives of the thai rak thai party . cat telecom claimed that it never received ptv \\'s application for internet access . \\n  under saprang \\'s leadership , 80 @,@ 000 subscribers of thai mobile , a tot / cat joint venture mobile phone operator , were cut off temporarily in early may 2007 when owners tot and cat telecom failed to pay the bills of a major supplier . thai mobile had accumulated significant losses and the company was not able to make its debt payments or supplier payments . the partners had stopped payments to the supplier , samart corporation , for nearly a year , until samart threatened to suspend services within three days . after no payment , it delivered on its threat . tot was subsequently able to negotiate with samart to restart the service . \\n  = = = airports of thailand = = = \\n  = = = = purging of aot management = = = = \\n  a week after saprang

despite warnings from engineers . karun chandrarangsu , president of the engineering institute of thailand noted , \" suvarnabhumi is like a patient in a coma who continues to suffer from severe bleeding . stopping the blood flow now is more urgent and important than debating what caused the injury . \" the engineering institute of thailand sent a formal warning to aot in november 2006 about the urgent need to drain water from beneath the tarmac , and noted that immediate action should be taken . \" the aot did nothing about the problem \" , suebsak promboon of the eit noted . \" the situation might not have become this bad if the water had been drained then . \" suebsak promboon , a senior foundation engineer and a member of the tortrakul yomnak @-@ led airport tarmac inspection panel , accused the aot of refusing to take any actions to solve the problems at the airport . \\n  the airport faced ongoing operational challenges , including a computer virus that shut down the automated luggage bomb @-@ scanning system in june 2007 . a study by the international air transport association ( iata ) released in july 2007 found the airport unsafe , citing numerous spots where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checkpoints . \\n  serious security gaps at suvarnabhumi airport became known to the public beginning in early 2007 . the international air transport association ( iata ) found that there were many spots in the passenger terminal where checked passengers can meet people who have not passed through security checks and could receive unchecked objects and then carry them on board aircraft . the iata also suggested that aot deploy its own security staff instead of contracting out the job to the loxley @-@ icts consortium . aot threatened the consortium with contract termination , but didn \\'t follow through with its threat , even though the consortium failed to live up to its contract . six months later , aot stated that it still couldn \\'t make up its mind on how it should improve airport security . aot said it was open to all possible options , and has taken no action to upgrade the problem . \\n  =

at major european airports . many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname , and the trip , which cost 7 @.@ 2 million baht was attacked for \" squandering \" state funds for personal pleasure , disbursing unrealistic expenses , and inflating costs . the travel agent along received a 500 @,@ 000 baht commission fee for booking the trip . saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign . he also noted that \" if you knew my character , you would know that even if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard . \" he also noted that instead of being a viewed as a defendant , he should be viewed as a hero for bringing down the thaksin government . saprang then summoned the leader of the aot labor union in order to identify who leaked information about the trip to his accusers . \\n  = = = = financial performance = = = = \\n  the first quarter after saprang was appointed chairman , aot profits plunged 90 % compared to the previous year , despite higher traffic volumes and increased passenger service charters and airline fees . operating expenses surged 137 % , contributing to the aot \\'s worst quarterly earnings report since it was listed on the stock exchange of thailand . \\n  the aot board also granted 200 million baht to the army , which had requested a financial donation . aot also lent some of its explosives detectors to the army for use in the south thailand insurrection . \\n  financial performance continued to spiral downwards in the 3rd quarter of 2007 . net profit for the period ending june fell by 84 % from a year before , despite higher traffic and a 17 @.@ 9 % increase in revenue . the fall in profit was attributed to aot \\'s court case against king power , the operator of duty @-@ free shops within suvarnabhumi airport . king power \\'s concession was suspended while the case was in court , forcing aot to stop reporting earnings from the concessionaire . \\n  = = = thaksin shinawatra = = = \\n  saprang had long been a fierce critic of thaksin shinawatra , and prior to the coup had even called thaksin \\'s supporters within the military \" evil . \" after the coup , saprang called thaksin a \" traitor \" and said that he should be \" banished to live forever in the jungle . \" \\n  he also accused thaksin of spying on the military while he was prime minister . \\n  although saprang and general sonthi accused thaksin of insulting and disrespecting king bhumibol , he noted that the junta did not pursue lèse majesté charges against thaksin because \" the police corrupted the evidence \" , and delivered such a weak case that the attorney @-@ general could not file a lawsuit . a vocal self @-@ proclaimed royalist , he insisted that various groups actively tried to challenge the monarchy , and that he \" couldn \\'t stand it . \" he noted , \" i am a soldier , born to protect the crown . they could only challenge the monarchy over my dead body . \" \\n  saprang also suspected that oliver jufer , a swiss man who was jailed for lèse majesté for spraying paint on a portrait of image of king bhumibol , was hired by somebody to perform his vandalism . saprang ordered a military investigation into the matter . the results have not been made public . \\n  = = = 2007 new years bombings = = = \\n  saprang had a public confrontation with former prime minister chavalit yongchaiyudh regarding the 2006 bangkok new year \\'s eve bombings after chavalit accused him of incompetence . saprang claimed that \" the evidence and intelligence information proves that the bombs were the dirty work of politicians who lost power and benefits . bad soldiers loyal to bad politicians collaborated with them with the intention to topple this government . \" however , his claim was contradicted just an hour later by prime minister surayud chulanont . \\n  in may 2007 , saprang claimed that he had information regarding the seizure of instructional manual on terrorism in bangkok from a london apartment by english soldiers and police . he said he could not disclose any further information , but told the public to connect the dots themselves . days later , a bomb exploded outside of chitrlada palace . saprang later clarified his remark , saying the bangkok terrorism manual discovery had been made in the early 1990s . deputy chief of the british mission in bangkok andy pierce said he was \" concerned \" by saprang \\'s remarks , which he insisted were \" baseless \" . \\n  = = = resignation of pridiyathorn devakula

lobbied him to sell shares of irpc ( formerly known as thai petrochemical industry ) back to a former shareholder . the newspaper identified saprang as the unnamed cns member . saprang \\'s brother , chienchuang , was a key financial advisor to prachai liaophairat , the estranged founder of tpi . \\n  chienchuang \\'s relations with the junta came under further public scrutiny when it was revealed that he was hired by the junta in order to lead a campaign to discredit deposed premier thaksin shinawatra . politicians hired as part of the cns campaign included chat pattana party leader korn

saprang was an extremely vocal critic of those who he perceived as his political opponents . in an interview with thai rath ( thailand \\'s most popular newspaper ) on 8 april 2007 , he called an

\\n  = = = post @-@ coup role = = = \\n  saprang was considered a strong contender to lead the junta given the mandatory retirement of army commander @-@ in @-@ chief and cns president sonthi boonyaratkalin in september 2007 . he unofficially competed with fellow assistant army commander anupong paochinda , who , as 1st army area commander , secured bangkok on the night of the coup . the bangkok post reported in october 2006 that sonthi was grooming anupong to be his successor by giving him responsibilities over coup logistics , a greater task than had been assigned to saprang . the asia times quoted a former mp as saying that \" anupong is seen as the real force behind the coup . saprang is more vocal , but he has no real base . the only way he could be seen as a promising leader is by pushing the country to the brink . \" \\n  in an interview , saprang warned that \" the three pillars of society - the nation , the religion and the monarchy - might crumble ... if rogue politicians return to power following the next [ post coup ] general election . \" \\n  saprang also held the opinion that military coups against the government \" should never be ruled out . \" the abrogated 1997 constitution had outlawed coups . a replacement constitution was , at the time of saprang \\'s statement , being drafted by a military appointed panel . \\n  saprang was sidelined in security plans preceding the constitutional tribunal \\'s 20 may 2007 ruling on the dissolution of the thai rak thai and democrat parties . after the 2006 coup , sonthi had delegated the task of securing bangkok to saprang . the pre @-@ ruling plan put sonthi directly in charge of bangkok crowd security , allying him with alum of afps class 9 , including army chief of staff general montri sangkhasap and first army region commander lt general prayuth chan @-@ ocha . \\n  panitan wattanayagorn , a military scholar at chulalongkorn university and a personal adviser to prime minister

noting that \" everything is over \" for him . bannawit himself was later transferred from defence ministry deputy permanent secretary to be a chief adviser of the ministry , replaced by chief advisor general toosarat muang @-@ am . bannawit denied that his own transfer was the result of his criticism of saprang \\'s transfer . bannawit then announced that he would resign from the military and

1887 – 92 – november 5 , 1937 ) was a vaudeville performance artist , thought to be of egyptian descent , who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation . his best @-@ known feats included water spouting , smoke swallowing , and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience . ali \\'s most famous stunt , and the highlight of his act , was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene , and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop . while these stunts were performed , a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed . \\n  although never gaining wide fame , ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the united states . he performed for heads of state including tsar nicholas ii of russia . judy garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and david blaine identified ali as his favorite magician . portions of his act were captured in the short film strange as it seems ( 1930 ) and in politiquerias ( 1931 ) , the spanish @-@ language version of laurel and hardy \\'s chickens come home . two documentaries contain footage of ali taken from politiquerias : 1977 \\'s gizmo ! , and 1999 \\'s vaudeville . ali \\'s unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the rockefeller institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post @-@ mortem . after he died in england , his body was offered to johns hopkins university for study , though the offer was declined . \\n  = = background = = \\n  hadji ali was born into a working @-@ class family in approximately 1887 or 1892 , depending on the source consulted , probably in egypt . his fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a \" regurgitation act \" , involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways . ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual gastric ability . he explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at st. mary \\'s hospital in niagara falls , new york , in may 1926 , that while swimming in the nile as a ten @-@ year @-@ old boy , he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a whale spouting . he continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older . a more dramatic version of these events was provided by ali \\'s daughter , almina ali , in an interview in england after his death . she stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident : while bathing in the nile , he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water . instead of dying , as those present thought he might , ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect . \\n  ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen : \\n  i tried out my tricks first of all in the street , swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to the other ... a cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day , and chased me down the street . i thought he wanted to beat me up , but no — all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick . finally , he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers . \\n  taking his abilities on the road , ali met an italian man in cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances . ali performed under contract throughout europe and at times for heads of state . according to ali , in or about 1914 he was summoned by tsar nicholas ii of russia to perform at the winter palace in saint petersburg , russia . he stated that the tsar \" must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration , which is now one of my most treasured possessions . \" following world war i , ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world , learning more tricks as he went . \\n  ali came to the united states with almina in the mid @-@ 1920s . they performed together at fairs , carnivals and in vaudeville , sometimes advertised under the collective name , \" hadji ali & co . \" almina played the part of assistant in her father \\'s act , billed in his shows as \" the princess \" . ali alone had a variety of stage names , including : \" the great egyptian miracle man \" , \" the amazing regurgitator \" , \" the egyptian enigma \" , \" the human aquarium \" , \" the human volcano \" and \" the 9th wonder of the scientific world \" . ali has been described as a \" large , barrel @-@ chested and bearded man ... [ that cut ] an imposing figure in his arab costume . \" \\n  although ali spoke a number of languages and became a naturalized u.s. citizen , it was reported that almina acted as his interpreter in the united states and other places , as he did not speak english and was illiterate . once he had gained some notoriety , ali took on as his manager hubert julian , a former colonel in the abyssinian air force . although he developed a significant following , even being named judy garland \\'s favorite vaudevillian , ali \" remained more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville headliner \" according to at least one source . nevertheless , at the time of his death in 1937 , julian commented that ali had \" earned big money in america — $ 1 @,@ 000 a week sometimes . i was building him up here [ in europe ] and had a continental tour arranged . \" \\n  = = performance = = \\n  the mainstay of ali \\'s act was \" water spouting \" . after swallowing large amounts of water , 60 to 100 glasses at a time , he spouted the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time , sometimes approaching one minute . another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled hazelnuts ( although one of his posters advertised 40 pecans ) , followed by another nut of a different variety , such as an almond . ali then brought them up one by one with the odd @-@ nut @-@ out produced at a mark called out by the audience . in another trick , ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members . \\n  in a 1929 article appearing in the lowell sun newspaper , physician morris fishbein speculated that for ali \\'s nut feat , the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed , thus allowing him to produce it on cue . dr. fishbein also stated that unnamed \" investigators \" were convinced that for ali \\'s handkerchief stunt , to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience ali flavored the cloth , and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up . ali also swallowed live goldfish , watches , coins , costume jewelry , paper money , peach pits , stones , live mice , buttons , pool balls and other odd objects . in another standard performance segment , he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling , he swallowed the smoke and , after a significant time had passed , issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano . \\n  ali \\'s longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again , but this time followed by a pint of kerosene . a prop was then produced , typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table , within which a small flame burned . lighter than water and immiscible with it , the kerosene floated above the liquid in ali \\'s gut , allowing him to disgorge it first . the stage thus set , and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells , ali became a \" human flamethrower \" , spewing the accelerant in a long stream over the sacrificial prop , setting it ablaze . once the kerosene was exhausted , the water followed , streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away , extinguishing the fire . \\n  at some performances , a panel or \" jury \" from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed — that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation . sometimes ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick . his stomach exposed by his standard costume , he invited audience members to pat his stomach , allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within . one newspaper reported that ali \\'s feats , essentially controlled vomiting , were performed in \" a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness . \" not everyone felt the same : at least one of ali \\'s engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act \" was killing their supper shows \" . famed escapologist and magician harry houdini remarked in his 1920 work miracle mongers and their methods that water spouting was a \" performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience . \" \\n  the abilities of ali fascinated the public and medical authorities . as reported in a 1928 sheboygan press article , at one of ali \\'s acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance . they came away satisfied that he was actually imbibing and regurgitating the material and objects as claimed , but remained \" mystified over his extraordinary performance . \" according to an article appearing in the naugatuck daily news , \" physicians of three continents have puzzled over the gastronomical mechanism of this human ostrich without success . x @-@ ray experiments have been made during his exhibition without a

battle of tellicherry was a naval action fought off the indian port of tellicherry between british and french warships on 18 november 1791 during the third anglo @-@ mysore war . britain and france were not at war at the time of the engagement , but french support for the kingdom of mysore in the conflict with the british east india company had led to royal navy patrols stopping and searching french ships sailing for the mysorean port of mangalore . when a french convoy from mahé passed the british port of tellicherry in november 1791 , commodore william cornwallis sent a small squadron to intercept the french ships . \\n  as the british force under captain sir richard strachan approached the convoy , the escorting frigate résolue opened fire . a general action followed , with strachan succeeding in forcing the french ship to surrender within twenty minutes and both sides suffering damage and casualties . all of the french vessels were searched and subsequently returned to mahé , the local french authorities reacting furiously at what they perceived as a violation of their neutral position . messages were sent back to france reporting the action from commodore saint @-@ félix but they evoked little response . although under normal circumstances the battle might have provoked a diplomatic incident , the upheavals of the ongoing french revolution meant that the despatches had little effect . \\n  = = background = = \\n  in december 1789 , after five years of diplomatic wrangling about the terms of the treaty of mangalore that had ended the second anglo @-@ mysore war , the ruler of mysore tipu sultan again declared war on the british east india company and their allies in southern india . for the next two years the war continued as british forces and their allies drove the mysore armies back towards the capital of seringapatam . both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland : the british forces were supported from their major ports at bombay and madras , later stationing additional forces at the small port of tellicherry inside mysore territory . the mysorean forces were supplied through mangalore by french ships . france had been an ally of the tipu sultan \\'s father hyder ali during the second anglo @-@ mysore war and although the political instability caused by the french revolution in europe prevented active involvement , they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to mysore throughout the war . \\n  in an effort to eliminate french support commodore william cornwallis , the british naval commander in the region , stationed a squadron of frigates at tellicherry , where they were ideally situated to blockade mangalore and prevent the passage of shipping into mysorean territory . the squadron consisted of cornwallis in hms minerva , captain sir richard strachan in hms phoenix and hms perseverance under captain isaac smith . the french operated a squadron of their own on the coast , led by commodore saint @-@ félix and consisting of two frigates based at mahé , a small french port 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of tellicherry . the french had communicated to the british at tellicherry that they would not submit to any attempts to search their vessels , but strachan and cornwallis replied that they would enforce the blockade of mangalore whatever the consequences . \\n  = = battle = = \\n  in november 1791 , a french convoy sailed from mahé on the short journey to mangalore . the convoy included two merchant vessels and the frigate résolue , a 36 @-@ gun warship under captain callamand . passing northwards , the convoy soon passed tellicherry and cornwallis sent strachan with phoenix and perseverance to stop and inspect the french ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies . as smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them , strachan did the same to résolue , hailing the french captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate . the french captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality , and responded by opening fire : british sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat , although phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged . \\n  strachan was unsurprised at the french reaction , and returned fire immediately , the proximity of the ships preventing any manoeuvres . within twenty minutes the combat was decided , the french captain hauling down his colours with his ship battered and more than 60 men wounded or dead . the french ship carried significantly weaker cannon than phoenix , with 6 and 12 pounder guns to the 9 and 18 pounders aboard the british squadron . in addition , résolue was heavily outnumbered : no other french warships were in the area while the british had three large frigates within sight . french losses eventually totalled 25 men killed and 60 wounded , strachan suffering just six killed and 11 wounded in return . \\n  = = aftermath = = \\n  with the enemy subdued , strachan ordered a thorough search of the captured vessels , but could find no contraband and returned control to the french commander . the french officer however refused , insisting that he and his ship were treated as prisoners of war . cornwallis ordered the merchant ships released to continue their journey and for the frigate to be towed back to mahé , where it was anchored in the roads with its sails and topmasts struck . provision was subsequently made at mahé by strachan for the wounded french sailors . soon afterwards saint @-@ félix arrived at mahé in his frigate cybèle and reacted furiously at the discovery that one of his neutral ships had been attacked and captured by the british . when cornwallis insisted that his ships had been acting within their orders , saint @-@ félix promised reprisals if any of his vessels were attacked again and withdrew with both cybèle and résolue later in the day , followed by minerva and phoenix . one account reported that saint @-@ félix actually ordered his crew to fire on cornwallis but that they refused . the british shadowed the french for several days , openly stopping and searching french merchant ships but without provoking a response from saint @-@ félix . résolue and phoenix were subsequently detached by their commanders , cornwallis and saint @-@ félix remaining in contact for several more days before finally separating . \\n  news of the encounter was conveyed back to france , but the country was at this time in one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing revolution and little notice was taken of events in india . historian william james notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications , while edward pelham brenton claims that the french deliberately ignored the report out of fear of antagonising britain . in britain , the admiralty approved of cornwallis \\' actions , suggesting that the french were deliberately using the guise of trade to support mysore against britain . the action had no effect on the ongoing war in india , which was now centred on the inland city of seringapatam . as british forces closed on the city in february 1792 , the tipu sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the company and its indian allies . \\n  = loose ( nelly furtado album ) = \\n  loose is the third studio album by canadian singer and songwriter nelly furtado , released on 6 june 2006 by geffen records and the mosley music group . following the release of furtado \\'s second album , folklore ( 2003 ) through dreamworks records , it was announced that universal music group would acquire dreamworks records , the later was folded into the interscope geffen a & m umbrella where furtado would release any new music . timbaland and his protégé danja produced the bulk of the album , which incorporates influences of dance , r & b and hip hop . the album explores the theme of female sexuality and has been described as introspective or even sad in parts . \\n  the album received criticism because of the sexual image furtado adopted for the recording , as some critics felt it was a ploy to sell more records . further controversy rose over accusations of plagiarism on timbaland \\'s part in the song \" do it \" ( which contained the melody from finnish musician janne suni \\'s song \" acidjazzed evening \" without proper authorization ) when recordings were leaked onto youtube . the record was seen generally as critically and commercially successful . it reached high positions on charts across the world , and according to an august 2009 press release , it had sold more than 12 million copies worldwide , making it the best @-@ selling album of 2006 – 07 and the twenty @-@ second best @-@ selling album of the 2000s . \\n  the album was heavily promoted , released in several editions and supported by the get loose tour , which is the subject of the concert dvd loose : the concert . \" loose \" debuted at number one , making it furtado \\'s first album to top the chart along with eight singles were released from the album , including the us number @-@ one singles \" promiscuous \" and \" say it right \" , which received grammy award nominations for best pop collaboration with vocals and best female pop vocal performance , respectively . other successful singles include the uk number @-@ one single \" maneater \" and the european number one single \" all good things ( come to an end ) \" . \\n  = = background = = \\n  furtado \\'s second album , folklore , was released in november 2003 . the lead single is \" powerless ( say what you want ) \" and the second single is the ballad \" try \" . the album was not as successful as her debut , partly due to the album \\'s less \" poppy \" sound . \" powerless ( say what you want ) \" was later remixed , featuring colombian rocker juanes , who had previously worked with furtado on his track \" fotografía \" ( \" photograph \" ) . the two would collaborate again on \" te busqué \" ( \" i searched for you \" ) , the single from furtado \\'s album loose . the album was underpromoted from her label dreamworks records ; it was announced on 11 november 2003 that universal music group reached an agreement to acquire dreamworks records from dreamworks skg for \" about $ 100 million \" . the purchase came at a time when the music business was \" going through major changes \" as it struggled to \" counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales \" . dreamworks records was folded into the interscope geffen a & m umbrella label in january 2004 . furtado \\'s recording contract was then absorbed into geffen records . \\n  = = recording = = \\n  furtado began work on loose by holding with emcee jellystone what she referred to as a \" hip @-@ hop workshop \" , in which they would \" write rhymes , dissect them , and try different flows over beats . \" the first producers she worked with were track & field — who co @-@ produced her first two albums , whoa , nelly ! ( 2000 ) and folklore ( 2003 ) — and by may 2005 , she had collaborated with swollen members and k \\'naan . she worked with nellee hooper in london on reggae @-@ oriented material and with lester mendez in los angeles on acoustic songs . one of the tracks mendez helped to create is \" te busqué \" , which is co @-@ written by and features juanes , who collaborated with furtado on his 2002 song \" fotografía \" . during her time in los angeles , she worked with rick nowels , who co @-@ wrote and produced \" in god \\'s hands \" and \" somebody to love \" . \\n  in miami , florida , furtado collaborated with pharrell ( who introduced her to reggaeton and who gave her a \" shout @-@ out \" in his 2005 single \" can i have it like that \" ) and scott storch ( with whom she recorded a \" straight @-@ up rap song \" ) before entering the studio with timbaland . he and his protégé at the time , danja , co @-@ produced eight of the tracks , with another produced solely by danja . for some of the beats on the songs , timbaland finished work on ones already present in the studio that were half @-@ developed or just \" nucleuses \" ; the rest were completely reworked . furtado recorded around forty tracks for loose , deciding which she would include based on the sonics of the album — she called timbaland \" a sonic extraterrestrial \" who came up with a sequence of songs that flowed , and said that the one she had devised was supposedly unsatisfactory . she recorded an unreleased collaboration with justin timberlake , \" crowd control \" , which she described as \" kind of sexy \" and \" a cute , clubby , upbeat , fun track \" . other songs considered for inclusion on the album include \" chill boy \" , \" friend of mine \" , \" go \" , \" hands in the air \" , \" pretty boy \" , \" vice \" and \" weak \" . \\n  furtado said in her diary on her official website that she recorded a remix of \" maneater \" with rapper lil wayne ; it was only released as part of a compilation album , timbaland \\'s remix & soundtrack collection , she also used the instrumental of the song during many television performances of \" maneater \" . a version of \" all good things ( come to an end ) \" featuring vocals by coldplay lead singer chris martin , who co @-@ wrote the song , was not released after a request from martin \\'s label , emi . the song was released on the album , but only furtado \\'s vocals are featured . furtado explained that \" loose was 90 percent written with a beat first , and then i ’ d write my melodies and songs to the beat . \" \\n  = = post @-@ production = = \\n  the \" off @-@ the @-@ cuff \" conclusion to production was one of the reasons the album was titled loose . it was named partly after the spontaneous decisions she made when creating the album . the album is also called loose because it is \" the opposite of calculated \" and came naturally to furtado and timbaland ; she called him her \" distant musical cousin because he was always pushing boundaries and always carving out his own path \" , which she believed she was doing with loose . \" i think you have to keep surprising people as an artist , and i like that — i love doing that \" , she said . loose was also named partly for the r & b girl group tlc , who furtado said she admires for \" taking back their sexuality , showing they were complete women . \" she said she wanted the album to be \" assertive and cool \" and \" sexy but fun \" , like tlc , mc lyte , queen latifah and janet jackson , who inspired furtado because , as she put it , she was \" comfortable in her sexuality and womanhood \" when her 1993 single \" that \\'s the way love goes \" was released . \\n  during the recording of loose , furtado listened to several electro and rock musicians , including bloc party , system of a down , m.i.a. , feist , queens of the stone age , metric and death from above 1979 , some of whom influenced the \" rock sound \" present on the album and the \" coughing , laughing , distorted basslines \" that were kept in the songs deliberately . according to her , music by such bands is \" very loud and has a garage theme \" to it , some of which she felt she captured on the album . furtado has said rock music is \" rhythmic again \" and hip hop @-@ influenced after it had become \" so churning and boring . \" because the mixing engineers were aware of timbaland and furtado \\'s rock influences , the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of \" the fancy mixer at the end \" . furtado said she preferred the louder volume that process gave to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo tapes , which she prefers to her finished albums . she said , \" it didn \\'t have that final wash over it ; it didn \\'t have the final pressing at the end , save for a couple sounds \" . \\n  = = music and lyrics = = \\n  furtado said that with the release of her albums before loose , she had wanted to prove herself as a musician and earn respect from listeners through using many different instruments on an album , which most hip hop musicians did not do . after she believed she had accomplished that , she felt she had freedom to make the type of music she \" really love [ d ] \" . furtado said her previous problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base one of her albums on , but that she then asked herself why she was being \" pretentious \" . the album represents her separating from such notions and , in her words , \" jumping in the deep end of the pool — \\' ahh , screw it , this is fun ! \\' \" . furtado said she considers herself \" all over the map \" and promiscuous musically because she is not faithful to one style . \\n  for the first time , furtado worked with a variety of record producers and followed a more collaborative approach in creating the album . produced primarily by timbaland and danja , loose showcases furtado experimenting with a more r & b – hip hop sound and , as she put it , the \" surreal , theatrical elements of \\' 80s music \" . she has categorized the album \\'s sound as punk @-@ hop , which she describes as eurythmics @-@ influenced \" modern , poppy , spooky music \" and stated that \" there \\'s a mysterious , after @-@ midnight vibe to [ it ] that \\'s extremely visceral \" . furtado has described the album as \" more urban , more american , more hip @-@ hop , [ and ] more simplified \" than her earlier work , which she said was more layered and textured because she \" tend [ s ] to overthink things \" . in contrast , during her studio time with timbaland , she said she was \" in the vip boys club of just letting go \" and being more impulsive . according to furtado , instead of \" pristine stuff \" , the album features \" really raw \" elements such as distorted bass lines , laughter from studio outtakes and general \" room for error \" . furtado has said loose is not as much about the lyrics , which are not included in the liner notes , as it is about \" indulging in pleasures — whether it \\'s dancing or lovemaking . \" according to her , she wasn \\'t trying to be sexy with the album — \" i think i just am sexy now \" , she said . \\n  = = songs = = \\n  the opening track , \" afraid \" ( featuring rapper attitude ) , is a description of furtado \\'s fear of what people think of her , and she has said the chorus reminds her of \" walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in . now that i \\'m an adult , i care about the inside of me ... before i said i didn \\'t care about what people thought about me , but i really did . \" \" maneater \" is an uptempo electro rock song that combines 1980s electro synths and a more dance @-@ oriented beat . the up @-@ tempo song has prominent electropop and synthpop influences and is lyrically related to how people become \" hot on themselves \" when dancing in their underwear in front of a mirror . \" promiscuous \" ( featuring timbaland ) was inspired by a flirting exchange furtado had with attitude , who co @-@ wrote the song \\n  she has characterised the fifth track , \" showtime \" , as \" a proper r & b slow jam \" . \" no hay igual \" is a hip hop and reggaeton song , that has a spanglish tongue twister over \" future @-@ tropic \" beats . the song contains a \" sharp mix \" of percussion and \" empowered chanting \" . in \" no hay igual \" , furtado sings in spanish and raps in portuguese over a reggaeton rhythm . the album also features more introspective songs , and the sunday times wrote that it \" has a surprising sadness to it . \" the seventh track , \" te busqué \" , which features latin singer juanes , is about furtado \\'s experiences with depression , which she said she has had periodically since she was around seventeen years old . furtado said she was unsure what \" say it right \" is about , but that it encapsulates her feeling when she wrote it and \" taps into this other sphere \" ; in an interview for the sunday times , it was mentioned that it is about her breakup with dj jasper gahunia , the father of her daughter . \" in god \\'s hands \" , another song on the album , was also inspired by the end of their relationship . \\n  = = singles = = \\n  in april 2006 , a remix of \" no hay igual \" featuring calle 13 was issued as a club single in the us . during the same period , \" promiscuous \" ( featuring timbaland ) was released for digital download in north america . promiscuous became furtado \\'s first single to top the us billboard hot 100 and was released in australia , where it reached the top five . the lead single in europe and latin america , \" maneater \" , was released in late may to early june 2006 . it became furtado \\'s first single to top the uk singles chart and made the top ten in other countries ;

in particular the music videos for \" promiscuous \" and \" maneater \" , in which she dances around with her midriff exposed . according to maclean \\'s magazine , some said that furtado \\'s progression was a natural transformation of a pop singer ; others believed that she had \" sold out \" in an effort to garner record sales , particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first . maclean \\'s wrote that her makeover \" seems a bit forced \" and contrasted her with singers such as madonna and emily haines of metric : \" [ they ] seem to be completely in control , even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality : they \\'ve made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons . in contrast , furtado \\'s new , overt sexuality comes off as unoriginal — overdone by thousands of pouty pop stars with a quarter of furtado \\'s natural talent ... the revamping feels as if it \\'s been imposed rather than chosen by the unique ,

of geffen \\'s jimmy iovine , who helped to develop the pussycat dolls , a girl group known for their sexually suggestive dance routines . the writer also criticised furtado \\'s discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of feminism in a blender magazine interview , writing : \" girls , do you hear that churning ? those are the ideas of gloria steinem turning in their grave . \" a

a chemical element with symbol sb ( from latin : stibium ) and atomic number 51 . a lustrous gray metalloid , it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite ( sb2s3 ) . antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics ; metallic antimony was also known , but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery . in the west , it was first isolated by vannoccio biringuccio and described in 1540 , although in primitive cultures its powder has been used to cure eye ailments , as also for eye shadow , since time immemorial , and is often referred to by its arabic name , kohl . \\n  for some time , china has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds , with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan . the industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and reduction using carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron . \\n  the largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead – acid batteries . alloying lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the alloys which are used in solders , bullets and plain bearings . antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine @-@ containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products . an emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics . \\n  = = characteristics = = \\n  = = = properties = = = \\n  antimony is in the nitrogen group ( group 15 ) and has an electronegativity of 2 @.@ 05 . as expected from periodic trends , it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth , and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic . antimony is stable in air at room temperature , but reacts with oxygen if heated , to form antimony trioxide , sb2o3 . \\n  antimony is a silvery , lustrous gray metalloid that has a mohs scale hardness of 3 . thus pure antimony is too soft to make hard objects ; coins made of antimony were issued in china \\'s guizhou province in 1931 , but because of their rapid wear , their minting was discontinued . antimony is resistant to attack by acids . \\n  four allotropes of antimony are known : a stable metallic form and three metastable forms ( explosive , black and yellow ) . elemental antimony is a brittle , silver @-@ white shiny metalloid . when slowly cooled , molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell , isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic . a rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride . when scratched with a sharp implement , an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony is formed ; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar , a strong detonation occurs . black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of vapor derived from metallic antimony . it has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic , it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously . at 100 ° c , it gradually transforms into the stable form . the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable . it has only been generated by oxidation of stibine ( sbh3 ) at − 90 ° c. above this temperature and in ambient light , this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope . \\n  elemental antimony adopts a layered structure ( space group r3m no. 166 ) in which layers consist of fused ruffled six @-@ membered rings . the nearest and next @-@ nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex , with the three atoms in the same double layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next . this relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6 @.@ 697 g / cm3 , but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony . \\n  = = = isotopes = = = \\n  antimony has two stable isotopes : 121sb with a natural abundance of 57 @.@ 36 % and 123sb with a natural abundance of 42 @.@ 64 % . it also has 35 radioisotopes , of which the longest @-@ lived is 125sb with a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 75 years . in addition , 29 metastable states have been characterized . the most stable of these is 120m1sb with a half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 76 days . isotopes that are lighter than the stable 123sb tend to decay by β + decay , and those that are heavier tend to decay by β − decay , with some exceptions . \\n  = = = occurrence = = = \\n  the abundance of antimony in the earth \\'s crust is estimated at 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 5 parts per million , comparable to thallium at 0 @.@ 5 parts per

frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite ( sb2s3 ) which is the predominant ore mineral . \\n  = = compounds = = \\n  antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state : sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) . the + 5 oxidation state is more stable . \\n  = = = oxides and hydroxides = = = \\n  antimony trioxide ( sb \\n  4o \\n  6 ) is formed when antimony is burnt in air . in the gas phase , this compound exists as sb \\n  4o \\n  6 , but it polymerizes upon condensing . antimony pentoxide ( sb \\n  4o \\n  10 ) can only be formed by oxidation by concentrated nitric acid . antimony also forms a mixed @-@ valence oxide , antimony tetroxide ( sb \\n  2o \\n  4 ) , which features both sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) . unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic , these various oxides are amphoteric , do not form well @-@ defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts . \\n  antimonous acid sb ( oh ) \\n  3 is unknown , but the conjugate base sodium antimonite ( [ na \\n  3sbo \\n  3 ] \\n  4 ) forms upon fusing sodium oxide and sb \\n  4o \\n  6 . transition metal antimonites are also known . antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate hsb ( oh ) \\n  6 , forming salts containing the antimonate anion sb ( oh ) − \\n  6 . dehydrating metal salts containing this anion yields mixed oxides . \\n  many antimony ores are sulfides , including stibnite ( sb \\n  2s \\n  3 ) , pyrargyrite ( ag \\n  3sbs \\n  3 ) , zinkenite , jamesonite , and boulangerite . antimony pentasulfide is non @-@ stoichiometric and features antimony in the + 3 oxidation state and s @-@ s bonds . several thioantimonides are known , such as [ sb \\n  6s \\n  10 ] 2 − and [ sb \\n  8s \\n  13 ] 2 − . \\n  = = = halides = = = \\n  antimony forms two series of halides : sbx \\n  3 and sbx \\n  5 . the trihalides sbf \\n  3 , sbcl \\n  3 , sbbr \\n  3 , and sbi \\n  3 are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry . \\n  the trifluoride sbf \\n  3 is

sbf − \\n  4 and sbf2 − \\n  5 . molten sbf \\n  3 is a weak electrical conductor . the trichloride sbcl \\n  3 is prepared by dissolving sb \\n  2s \\n  3 in hydrochloric acid : \\n  sb \\n  2s \\n  3 + 6 hcl → 2 sbcl \\n  3 + 3 h \\n  2s \\n  the pentahalides sbf \\n  5 and sbcl \\n  5 have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase , but in the liquid phase , sbf \\n  5 is polymeric , whereas sbcl \\n  5 is monomeric . sbf \\n  5 is a powerful lewis acid used to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid ( \" h2sbf7 \" ) . \\n  oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus . antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and ( sbo ) \\n  2so \\n  4 . \\n  = = = antimonides , hydrides , and organoantimony compounds = = = \\n  compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of sb3 − . antimony forms antimonides with metals , such as indium antimonide ( insb ) and silver antimonide ( ag \\n  3sb ) . the alkali metal and zinc antimonides , such as na3sb and zn3sb2 , are more reactive . treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas stibine , sbh \\n  3 : \\n  sb3 − + 3 h + → sbh \\n  3 \\n  stibine can also be produced by treating sb3 + salts with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride.stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature . because stibine has a positive heat of formation , it is thermodynamically unstable and thus antimony does not react with hydrogen directly . \\n  organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with grignard reagents . a large variety of compounds are known with both sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) centers , including mixed chloro @-@ organic derivatives , anions , and cations . examples include sb ( c6h5 ) 3 ( triphenylstibine ) , sb2 ( c6h5 ) 4 ( with an sb @-@ sb bond ) , and cyclic [ sb ( c6h5 ) ] n . pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common , examples being sb ( c6h5 ) 5 and several related halides . \\n  = = history = = \\n  antimony ( iii ) sulfide , sb2s3 , was recognized in predynastic egypt as an eye cosmetic ( kohl ) as early as about 3100 bc , when the cosmetic palette was invented . \\n  an artifact , said to be part of a vase , made of antimony dating to about 3000 bc was found at telloh , chaldea ( part of present @-@ day iraq ) , and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 bc and 2200 bc has been found in egypt . austen , at a lecture by herbert gladstone in 1892 commented that \" we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal , which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase , and therefore this remarkable \\' find \\' ( artifact mentioned above ) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable . \" \\n  moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase , mentioning that selimkhanov , after his analysis of the tello object ( published in 1975 ) , \" attempted to relate the metal to transcaucasian natural antimony \" ( i.e. native metal ) and that \" the antimony objects from transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments . \" this weakens the evidence for a lost art \" of rendering antimony malleable . \" \\n  the roman scholar pliny the elder described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise natural history . pliny the elder also made a distinction between \" male \" and \" female \" forms of antimony ; the male form is probably the sulfide , while the female form , which is superior , heavier , and less friable , has been suspected to be native metallic antimony . \\n  the roman naturalist pedanius dioscorides mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air . it is thought that this produced metallic antimony . \\n  the first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book de la pirotechnia of 1540 by vannoccio biringuccio ; this predates the more famous 1556 book by agricola , de re metallica . in this context agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony . the book currus triumphalis antimonii ( the triumphal chariot of antimony ) , describing the preparation of metallic antimony , was published in germany in 1604 . it was purported to have been written by a benedictine monk , writing under the name basilius valentinus , in the 15th century ; if it were authentic , which it is not , it would predate biringuccio . \\n  the metal antimony was known to german chemist andreas libavius in 1615 who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide , salt and potassium tartrate . this procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface . \\n  with the advent of challenges to phlogiston theory it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides , oxides , and other compounds , as is the case with other metals . \\n  the first natural occurrence of pure antimony in the earth \\'s crust was described by the swedish scientist and local mine district engineer anton von swab in 1783 ; the type @-@ sample was collected from the sala silver mine in the bergslagen mining district of sala , västmanland , sweden . \\n  = = = etymology = = = \\n  the ancient words for antimony mostly have , as their chief meaning , kohl , the sulfide of antimony . \\n  the egyptians called antimony mśdmt ; in hieroglyphs , the vowels are uncertain , but there is an arabic tradition that the word is ميسديميت mesdemet . the greek word , στίμμι stimmi , is probably a loan word from arabic or from egyptian stm \\n  and is used by attic tragic poets of the 5th century bc ; later greeks also used στἰβι stibi , as did celsus and pliny , writing in latin , in the first century ad . pliny also gives the names stimi [ sic ] , larbaris , alabaster , and the \" very common \" platyophthalmos , \" wide @-@ eye \" ( from the effect of the cosmetic ) . later latin authors adapted the word to latin as stibium . the arabic word for the substance , as opposed to the cosmetic , can appear as إثمد ithmid , athmoud , othmod , or uthmod . littré suggests the first form , which is the earliest , derives from stimmida , an accusative for stimmi . \\n  the use of sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to jöns jakob berzelius , who used this abbreviation of the name stibium . the medieval latin form , from which the modern languages and late byzantine greek take their names for antimony , is antimonium . the origin of this is uncertain ; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation . the popular etymology , from ἀντίμοναχός anti @-@ monachos or french antimoine , still has adherents ; this would mean \" monk @-@ killer \" , and is explained by many early alchemists being monks , and antimony being poisonous . \\n  another popular etymology is the hypothetical greek word ἀντίμόνος antimonos , \" against aloneness \" , explained as \" not found as metal \" , or \" not found unalloyed \" . lippmann conjectured a hypothetical greek word ανθήμόνιον anthemonion , which would mean \" floret \" , and cites several examples of related greek words ( but not that one ) which describe chemical or biological efflorescence . \\n  the early uses of antimonium include the translations , in 1050 – 1100 , by constantine the african of arabic medical treatises . several authorities believe antimonium is a scribal corruption of some arabic form ; meyerhof derives it from ithmid ; other possibilities include athimar , the arabic name of the metalloid , and a hypothetical as @-@ stimmi , derived from or parallel to the greek . \\n  = = production = = \\n  = = = top producers and production volumes = = = \\n  the british geological survey ( bgs ) reported that in 2005 , china was the top producer of antimony with an approximately 84 % world share , followed at a distance by south africa , bolivia and tajikistan . xikuangshan mine in hunan province has the largest deposits in china with an estimated deposit of 2 @.@ 1 million metric tons . \\n  in 2010 , according to the us geological survey , china accounted for 88 @.@ 9 % of total antimony production with south africa , bolivia and russia sharing the second place . \\n  however , roskill consulting estimates for primary production show that in 2010 china held a 76 @.@ 75 % share of world supply with 120 @,@ 462 tonnes ( 90 @,@ 000 tonnes of reported and 30 @,@ 464 tonnes of un @-@ reported

( 3 @.@ 42 % share , 5 @,@ 370 tonnes ) and bolivia ( 3 @.@ 17 % share , 4 @,@ 980 tonnes ) . \\n  roskill estimates that secondary production globally in 2010 was 39 @,@ 540 tonnes . \\n  antimony was ranked first in a risk list published by the british geological survey in the second half of 2011 . the list provides an indication of the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current british economy and lifestyle . \\n  also , antimony was identified as one of 12 critical raw materials for the eu in a report published in 2011 , primarily due to the lack of supply outside china . \\n  reported production of antimony in china fell in 2010 and is unlikely to increase in the coming years , according to the roskill report . no significant antimony deposits in china have been developed for about ten years , and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted . \\n  the world \\'s largest antimony producers , according to roskill , are listed below : \\n  = = = reserves = = = \\n  according to statistics from the usgs , current global reserves of antimony will be depleted in 13 years . however , the usgs expects more resources will be found . \\n  = = = production process = = = \\n  the extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality of the ore and composition of the ore . most antimony is mined as the sulfide ; lower @-@ grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation , while higher @-@ grade ores are heated to 500 – 600 ° c , the temperature at which stibnite melts and is separated from the gangue minerals . antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by a reduction with scrap iron : \\n  sb \\n  2s \\n  3 + 3 fe → 2 sb + 3 fes \\n  the sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony ( iii ) oxide , which is recovered from roasting . this material is often used directly for the main applications , impurities being arsenic and sulfide . isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction : \\n  2 sb \\n  2o \\n  3 + 3 c → 4 sb + 3 co \\n  2 \\n  the lower @-@ grade ores are reduced in blast furnaces while the higher @-@ grade ores are reduced in reverberatory furnaces . \\n  = = applications = = \\n  about 60 % of antimony is consumed in flame retardants , and 20 % is used in alloys for batteries , plain bearings and solders . \\n  = = = flame retardants = = = \\n  antimony is mainly used as its trioxide in making flame @-@ proofing compounds . it is nearly always used in combination with halogenated flame retardants , with the only exception being in halogen @-@ containing polymers . the formation of halogenated antimony compounds is the cause for the flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide , due to reaction of these compounds with hydrogen atoms and probably also with oxygen atoms and oh radicals , thus inhibiting fire . markets for these flame @-@ retardant applications include children \\'s clothing , toys , aircraft and automobile seat covers . it is also used in the fiberglass composites industry as an additive to polyester resins for such items as light aircraft engine covers . the resin will burn while a flame is held to it but will extinguish itself as soon as the flame is removed . \\n  = = = alloys = = = \\n  antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead , increasing its hardness and mechanical strength . for most applications involving lead , varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal . in lead – acid batteries , this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging . it is used in antifriction alloys ( such as babbitt metal ) , in bullets and lead shot , cable sheathing , type metal ( for example , for linotype printing machines ) , solder ( some \" lead @-@ free \" solders contain 5 % sb ) , in pewter , and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of organ pipes . \\n  = = = other applications = = = \\n  three other applications make up nearly all the rest of the consumption . one of these uses is as a stabilizer and a catalyst for the production of polyethyleneterephthalate . another application is to serve as a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in glass , mostly for tv screens ; this is achieved by the interaction of antimony ions with oxygen , interfering the latter from forming bubbles . the third major application is the use as pigment . \\n  antimony is being increasingly used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant for heavily doped n @-@ type silicon wafers in the production of diodes , infrared detectors , and hall @-@ effect devices . in the 1950s , tiny beads of a lead @-@ antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of n @-@ p @-@ n alloy junction transistors with antimony . indium antimonide is used as a material for mid @-@ infrared detectors . \\n  few biological or medical applications exist for antimony . treatments principally containing antimony are known as antimonials and are used as emetics . antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs . potassium antimonyl tartrate , or tartar emetic , was once used as an anti @-@ schistosomal drug from 1919 on . it was subsequently replaced by praziquantel . antimony and its compounds are used in several veterinary preparations like anthiomaline or lithium antimony thiomalate , which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants . antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues , at least in animals . \\n  antimony @-@ based drugs , such as meglumine antimoniate , are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in domestic animals . unfortunately , as well as having low therapeutic indices , the drugs are poor at penetrating the bone marrow , where some of the leishmania amastigotes reside , and so cure of the disease – especially the visceral form – is very difficult . elemental antimony as an antimony pill was once used as a medicine . it could be reused by others after ingestion and elimination . \\n  in the heads of some safety matches , antimony ( iii ) sulfide is used . antimony @-@ 124 is used together with beryllium in neutron sources ; the gamma rays emitted by antimony @-@ 124 initiate the photodisintegration of beryllium . the emitted neutrons have an average energy of 24 kev . antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials . \\n  antimony also is used in the making of bullets and bullet tracers . this element is also used in paint and glass art crafts and as opacifier in enamel . \\n  = = precautions = = \\n  the effects of antimony and its compounds on human and environmental health differ widely . the massive antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health . inhalation of antimony trioxide ( and similar poorly soluble sb ( iii ) dust particles such as antimony dust ) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer . however , these effects are only observed with female rats and after long @-@ term exposure to high dust concentrations . the effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance , lung overload , inflammation and ultimately tumour formation , not to exposure to antimony ions ( oecd , 2008 ) . antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin . the effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic ; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake , metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony . \\n  for oral absorption , icrp ( 1994 ) recommended values of 10 % for tartar emetic and 1 % for all other antimony compounds . dermal absorption for metals is estimated at most 1 % ( herag , 2007 ) . inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble sb ( iii ) substances ( such as antimony dust ) is estimated at 6 @.@ 8 % ( oecd , 2008 ) , whereas a value < 1 % is derived for sb ( v ) substances . antimony ( v ) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony ( iii ) in the cell , and both species exist simultaneously . \\n  antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine . antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects , with the exception of antimony potassium tartrate ( \" tartar emetic \" ) , a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat leishmaniasis patients . \\n  prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis . however , it was agreed at the european union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance @-@ specific , but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts ( echa / pr / 09 / 09 , helsinki , 6 july 2009 ) . antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air ; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible . \\n  antimony is incompatible with strong acids , halogenated acids , and oxidizers ; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form stibine ( sbh3 ) . \\n  the 8 hour time weighted average ( twa ) is set at 0 @.@ 5 mg / m3 by the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists and by the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) as a legal permissible exposure limit ( pel ) in the workplace . the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of 0 @.@ 5 mg / m3 as an 8 hour twa . antimony compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) production . some studies report minor antimony leaching from pet bottles into liquids , but levels are below drinking water guidelines . antimony concentrations in fruit juice concentrates were somewhat higher ( up to 44 @.@ 7 µg / l of antimony ) , but juices do not fall under the drinking water regulations . the drinking water guidelines are : \\n  world health organization : 20 µg / l \\n  japan : 15 µg / l \\n  united states environmental protection agency , health canada and the ontario ministry of environment : 6 µg / l \\n  eu and german federal ministry of environment : 5 µg / l \\n  the tdi proposed by who is 6 µg antimony per kilogram of body weight . the idlh ( immediately dangerous to life and health ) value for antimony is 50 mg / m3 . \\n  = mortimer wheeler = \\n  sir robert eric mortimer wheeler ch , cie , mc , td , fsa , frs , fba ( 10 september 1890 – 22 july 1976 ) was a british archaeologist and officer in the british army . over the course of his career , he served as director of both the national museum of wales and london museum , director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india , and the founder and honorary director of the institute of archaeology in london , further writing twenty @-@ four books on archaeological subjects . \\n  born in glasgow to a middle @-@ class family , wheeler was raised largely in yorkshire before relocating to london in his teenage years . after studying classics at university college london ( ucl ) , he began working professionally in archaeology , specializing in the romano @-@ british period . during world war i he volunteered for service in the royal artillery , being stationed on the western front , where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the military cross . returning to britain , he obtained his doctorate from ucl before taking on a position at the national museum of wales , first as keeper of archaeology and then as director , during which time he oversaw excavation at the roman forts of segontium , y gaer , and isca augusta with the aid of his first wife , tessa wheeler . influenced by the archaeologist augustus pitt rivers , wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach , developing the \" wheeler method \" . in 1926 , he was appointed keeper of the london museum ; there , he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection , successfully lobbied for increased funding , and began lecturing at ucl . \\n  in 1934 , he established the institute of archaeology as part of the federal university of london , adopting the position of honorary director . in this period , he oversaw excavations of the roman sites at lydney park and verulamium and the iron age hill fort of maidan castle . during world war ii , he re @-@ joined the armed forces and rose to the rank of brigadier , serving in the north african campaign and then the allied invasion of italy . in 1944 he was appointed director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india , through which he oversaw excavations of sites at harappa , arikamedu , and brahmagiri , and implemented reforms to the subcontinent \\'s archaeological establishment . returning to britain in 1948 , he divided his time between lecturing for the institute of archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to pakistan \\'s government . in later life , his popular books , cruise ship lectures , and appearances on radio and television , particularly the bbc series animal , vegetable , mineral ? , helped to bring archaeology to a mass audience . appointed honorary secretary of the british academy , he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects , and was appointed british representative for several unesco projects . \\n  wheeler is recognised as one of the most important british archaeologists of the twentieth century , responsible for successfully encouraging british public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording . further , he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of south asian archaeology . however , many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or reinterpreted , and he was often criticised for bullying colleagues and sexually harassing young women . \\n  = = early life = = \\n  = = = childhood : 1890 – 1907 = = = \\n  mortimer wheeler was born on 10 september 1890 in the city of glasgow , scotland . he was the first child of the journalist robert mortimer wheeler and his second wife emily wheeler ( née baynes ) . the son of a tea merchant based in bristol , in youth robert had considered becoming a baptist minister , but instead became a staunch freethinker while studying at the university of edinburgh . initially working as a lecturer in english literature , robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth . his second wife , emily , shared her husband \\'s interest in english literature , and was the niece of thomas spencer baynes , a shakespearean scholar at st. andrews university . their marriage was emotionally strained , a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity . within two years of their son \\'s birth , the family moved to edinburgh , where a daughter named amy was born . the couple gave their two children nicknames , with mortimer being \" boberic \" and amy being \" totsy \" . \\n  when wheeler was four , his father was appointed chief leader writer for the bradford observer . the family relocated to saltaire , a village northwest of bradford , a cosmopolitan city in yorkshire , northeast england , which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom . wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding saltaire and fascinated by the area \\'s archaeology . he later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup @-@ marked stone , searching for lithics on ilkley moor , and digging into a barrow on baildon moor . although suffering from ill health , emily wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight . mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother , instead being far closer to his father , whose company he favoured over that of other children . his father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting , rural pursuits in which he encouraged mortimer to take part . robert acquired many books for his son , particularly on the subject of art history , with wheeler loving to both read and paint . \\n  in 1899 , wheeler joined bradford grammar school shortly before his ninth birthday , where he proceeded straight to the second form . in 1902 robert and emily had a second daughter , whom they named betty ; mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister . in 1905 , robert agreed to take over as head of the london office of his newspaper , by then renamed the yorkshire daily observer , and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in december , settling into a house named carlton lodge on south croydon road , west dulwich . in 1908 they moved to 14 rollescourt avenue in nearby herne hill . rather than being sent for a conventional education , when he was 15 wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in london , where he frequented the national gallery and the victoria and albert museum . \\n  = = = university and early career : 1907 – 14 = = = \\n  after passing the entrance exam on his second attempt , in 1907 wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read classical studies at university college london ( ucl ) , commuting daily from his parental home to the university campus in bloomsbury , central london . at ucl , he was taught by the prominent classicist a. e. housman . during his undergraduate studies , he became editor of the union magazine , for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons . increasingly interested in art , he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at ucl \\'s art school , the slade school of fine art ; he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than \" a conventionally accomplished picture maker \" . this interlude had adversely affected his classical studies , and he received a second class ba on graduating . \\n  wheeler began studying for a master of arts degree in classical studies , which he attained in 1912 . during this period , he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the ucl provost gregory foster , although he later criticised foster for transforming the university from \" a college in the truly academic sense [ into ] a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man \" . it was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with tessa verney , a student then studying history at ucl , when they were both serving on the committee of the university college literary society . \\n  during his studies , wheeler had developed his love of archaeology , having joined an excavation of viroconium cornoviorum , a romano @-@ british settlement in wroxeter , in 1913 . considering a profession in the discipline , he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the university of london and the society of antiquaries in memory of augustus wollaston franks . the prominent archaeologist sir arthur evans doubled the amount of money that went with the studentship . wheeler \\'s proposed project had been to analyse romano @-@ rhenish pottery , and with the grant he funded a trip to the rhineland in germany , there studying the roman pottery housed in local museums ; his research into this subject was never published . \\n  at this period , there were very few jobs available within british archaeology ; as the later archaeologist stuart piggott related , \" the young wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created . \" in 1913 wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the english royal commission on historical monuments , who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre @-@ dated 1714 . as part of this , he was first sent to stebbing in essex to assess late medieval buildings , although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the romano @-@ british remains of that county . in summer 1914 he married tessa in a low @-@ key , secular wedding ceremony , before they moved into wheeler \\'s parental home in herne hill . \\n  = = = first world war : 1914 – 18 = = = \\n  after the united kingdom \\'s entry into world war i in 1914 , wheeler volunteered for the armed forces . although preferring solitary to group activities , wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering . for the next seven months , he was posted as an instructor in the university of london officer training corps . it was during this period , in january 1915 , that a son was born to the wheelers , and named michael . michael was their only child , something that was a social anomaly at the time , although it is unknown if this was by choice or not . in may 1915 , wheeler transferred to the royal field artillery ( territorial force ) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain . in this position he was stationed at various bases across britain , often bringing his wife and child with him ; his responsibility was as a battery commander , initially of field guns and later of howitzers . \\n  in october 1917 wheeler was posted to the 76th army field artillery brigade , one of the royal field artillery brigades under the direct control of the general officer commanding , third army . the brigade was then stationed in belgium , where it had been engaged in the battle of passchendaele against german troops along the western front . there , he was immediately placed in command of an artillery battery , replacing a major who had been poisoned by mustard gas . being promoted to the rank of acting major , he was part of the left group of artillery covering the advancing allied infantry in the battle . throughout , he maintained correspondences with his wife , his sister amy , and his parents . after the allied victory in the battle , the brigade was transferred to italy . \\n  wheeler and the brigade arrived in italy on 20 november , and proceeded through the italian riviera to reach caporetto , where it had been sent to bolster the italian troops against a german and austro @-@ hungarian advance . as the russian republic removed itself from the war , the german army refocused its efforts on the western front , and so in march 1918 wheeler \\'s brigade was ordered to leave italy , getting a train from castelfranco to vieux rouen in france . back on the western front , the brigade was assigned to the 2nd division , again part of julian byng \\'s third army , reaching a stable area of the front in april . here , wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months , before the british went on the offensive in august . on 24 august , in between the ruined villages of achiet and sapignies , he led an expedition which captured two german field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound ; he was later awarded the military cross for this action . wheeler continued as part of the british forces pushing westward until the german surrender in november 1918 . he was not demobilised for several months , instead being stationed at pulheim in germany until march ; during this time he wrote up his earlier research on romano @-@ rhenish pottery , making use of access to local museums , before returning to london in july 1919 . \\n  = = career = = \\n  = = = national museum of wales : 1919 – 26 = = = \\n  on returning to london , wheeler moved into a top @-@ floor flat near gordon square with his wife and child . he returned to working for the royal commission , examining and cataloguing the historic structures of essex . in doing so , he produced his first publication , an academic paper on colchester \\'s roman balkerne gate which was published in the transactions of the essex archaeological society in 1920 . he soon followed this with two papers in the journal of roman studies ; the first offered a wider analysis of roman colchester , while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city \\'s temple of claudius which was destroyed by boudica \\'s revolt . in doing so , he developed a reputation as a roman archaeologist in britain . he then submitted his research on romano @-@ rhenish pots to the university of london , on the basis of which he was awarded his doctorate of letters ; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as dr wheeler . he was unsatisfied with his job in the commission , unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army , and so began to seek out alternative employment . \\n  he obtained a post as the keeper of archaeology at the national museum of wales , a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at the university college of south wales and monmouthshire . taking up this position , he moved to cardiff with his family in august 1920 , although he initially disliked the city . the museum was in disarray ; prior to the war , construction had begun on a new purpose @-@ built building to house the collections . this had ceased during the conflict and the edifice was left abandoned during cardiff \\'s post @-@ war economic slump . wheeler recognised that wales was very divided regionally , with many welsh people having little loyalty to cardiff ; thus , he made a point of touring the country , lecturing to local societies about archaeology . according to the later archaeologist lydia c. carr , the wheelers \\' work for the cause of the museum was part of a wider \" cultural @-@ nationalist movement \" linked to growing welsh nationalism during this period ; for instance , the welsh nationalist party plaid cymru was founded in 1925 . \\n  wheeler was impatient to start excavations , and in july 1921 started a six @-@ week project to excavate at the roman fort of segontium ; accompanied by his wife , he used up his holiday to oversee the project . a second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922 . greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist augustus pitt @-@ rivers , wheeler emphasised the need for a strong , developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation , believing in the need for strategic planning , or what he termed \" controlled discovery \" , with clear objectives in mind for a project . further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results , he wrote full seasonal reports for archaeologia cambrensis before publishing a full report , segontium and the roman occupation of wales . wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists , and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at segontium were victor nash @-@ williams and ian richmond . \\n  over the field seasons of 1924 and 1925 , wheeler ran excavations of the roman fort of y gaer near brecon , a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students , nowell myres and christopher hawkes . during this project , he was visited by the prominent egyptologist sir flinders petrie and his wife hilda petrie ; wheeler greatly admired petrie \\'s emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies . wheeler published the results of his excavation in the roman fort near brecon . he then began excavations at isca augusta , a roman site in caerleon , where he focused on revealing the roman amphitheatre . intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding , he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle @-@ market newspaper the daily mail . in doing so , he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with king arthur . in 1925 , oxford university press published wheeler \\'s first book for a general audience , prehistoric and roman wales ; he later expressed the opinion that it was not a good book . \\n  in 1924 , the director of the national museum of wales , william evans hoyle , resigned amid ill health . wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement , providing supportive testimonials from charles reed peers , robert bosanquet , and h. j. fleure . although he had no prior museum experience , he was successful in his application and was appointed director . he then employed a close friend , cyril fox , to take on the vacated position of keeper of archaeology . wheeler \\'s proposed reforms included extending the institution \\'s reach and influence throughout wales by building affiliations with regional museums , and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises . he obtained a £ 21 @,@ 367 donation from the wealthy shipowner william reardon smith and appointed smith to be the museum \\'s treasurer , and also travelled to whitehall , london , where he successfully urged the british treasury to provide further funding for the museum . as a result , construction on the museum \\'s new building was able to continue , and it was officially opened by king george v in 1927 . \\n  = = = london museum : 1926 – 33 = = = \\n  upon the retirement of the keeper of the london museum , harmon oates , wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy . he had been considering a return to london for some time and eagerly agreed , taking on the post , which was based at lancaster house in the st james \\'s area , in july 1926 . in wales , many felt that wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the national museum to advance his own career prospects , and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along . wheeler himself disagreed , believing that he had left fox at the museum as his obvious successor , and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue . the position initially provided wheeler with an annual salary of £ 600 , which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family , who moved into a flat near to victoria station . \\n  tessa \\'s biographer l.c. carr later commented that together , the wheelers \" professionalized the london museum \" . wheeler expressed his opinion that the museum \" had to be cleaned , expurgated , and catalogued ; in general , turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution \" . focusing on reorganising the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing the artefacts , he also authored a short guide to the collections , before using the items in the museum to write three books : london and the vikings , london and the saxons , and london and the romans . upon his arrival , the treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of £ 5 @,@ 000 , which wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs . in 1930 , wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget , as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers , publications , and acquisitions , as well as a rise in the number of educational projects . with this additional funding , he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to £ 900 . \\n  soon after joining the museum , wheeler was elected to the council of the society of antiquaries . through the society , he became involved in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in greater london ; his argument was that the city of london corporation should provide the funding , although in 1926 it was agreed that the society itself would employ a director of excavation based in lancaster house to take on the position . also involved in the largely moribund royal archaeological institute , wheeler organised its relocation to lancaster house . in 1927 , wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at university college london , where he established a graduate diploma course on archaeology ; one of the first to enroll was stuart piggott . in 1928 , wheeler curated an exhibit at ucl on \" recent work in british archaeology \" , for which he attracted much press attention . \\n  wheeler was keen to continue archaeological fieldwork outside london , undertaking excavations every year from 1926 to 1939 . after completing his excavation of the carlaeon amphitheatre in 1928 , he began fieldwork at the roman settlement and temple in lydney park , gloucestershire , having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner , charles bathurst . it was during these investigations that wheeler personally discovered the lydney hoard of coinage . wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as report on the excavation of the prehistoric , roman and post @-@ roman site in lydney park , gloucestershire , which piggott noted had \" set the pattern \" for all wheeler \\'s future excavation reports . \\n  from there , wheeler was invited to direct a society of antiquaries excavation at the roman settlement of verulamium , which existed on land recently acquired by the corporation of st albans . he took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933 , before leaving a fifth season of excavation under the control of the archaeologist kathleen kenyon and the architect a. w. g. lowther . wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site , and also liked its proximity to his home in london . he was particularly interested in searching for a pre @-@ roman iron age oppidum at the site , noting that the existence of a nearby catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence . with wheeler focusing his attention on potential iron age evidence , tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls ; wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project . after tessa wrote two interim reports , the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as verulamium : a belgic and two roman cities , jointly written by wheeler and his wife . the report resulted in the first major published criticism of wheeler , produced by the young archaeologist nowell myres in a review for antiquity ; although stating that there was much to praise about the work , he critiqued wheeler \\'s selective excavation , dubious dating , and guesswork . wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both myres and myres \\'s employer , christ church , oxford . \\n  = = = institute of archaeology : 1934 – 39 = = = \\n  wheeler had long desired to establish an academic institution devoted to archaeology that could be based in london . he hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish the professionalisation of archaeology as a discipline , with systematic training of students in methodological techniques of excavation and conservation and recognised professional standards ; in his words , he hoped \" to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses \" . he further described his intention that the institute should become \" a laboratory : a laboratory of archaeological science \" . many archaeologists shared his hopes , and to this end petrie had donated much of his collection of near eastern artefacts to wheeler , in the hope that it would be included in such an institution . wheeler was later able to persuade the university of london , a federation of institutions across the capital , to support the venture , and both he and tessa began raising funds from wealthy backers . in 1934 , the institute of archaeology was officially opened , albeit at this point without premises or academic staff ; the first students to enroll were rachel clay and barbara parker , who went on to have careers in the discipline . while wheeler – who was still keeper of the london museum – took on the role of honorary director of the institute , he installed the archaeologist kathleen kenyon as secretary of the management committee , describing her as \" a level @-@ headed person , with useful experience \" . \\n  after ending his work at verulamium , wheeler turned his attention to the late iron age hill @-@ fort of maidan castle near to dorchester , dorset , where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937 . co @-@ directed by wheeler , tessa , and the curator of dorset county museum , charles drew , the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the society of antiquaries and the dorset field club . with around 100 assistants each season , the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in britain up to that point , with wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries . his excavation report was published in 1943 as maidan castle , dorset . the report \\'s publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of wheeler \\'s approach and interpretations ; in his review of the book , the archaeologist w. f. grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation , noting that wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio @-@ economic issues of the community at maidan castle , aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to british archaeology . over coming decades , as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of iron age britain , much of wheeler \\'s interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong , in particular by the work of the archaeologist niall sharples . \\n  in 1936 , wheeler embarked on a visit to the near east , sailing from marseilles to port said , where he visited the old kingdom tombs of sakkara . from there he went via sinai to palestine , lebanon , and syria . during this trip , he visited various archaeological projects , but was dismayed by the quality of their excavations ; in particular , he noted that the american @-@ run excavation at tel megiddo was adopting standards that had been rejected in britain twenty @-@ five years previously . he was away for six weeks , and upon his return to europe discovered that his wife tessa had died of a pulmonary embolism after a minor operation on her toe . according to tessa \\'s biographer , for wheeler this discovery was \" the peak of mental misery , and marked the end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love \" . that winter , his father also died . by the summer of 1937 , he had embarked on a new romance , with a young woman named mavis de vere cole , who had first met wheeler when visiting the maidan castle excavations with her then @-@ lover , the painter augustus john . after she eventually agreed to his repeated requests for marriage , the two were wedded early in 1939 in a ceremony held at caxton hall , with a reception at shelley house . they proceeded on a honeymoon to the middle east . \\n  after a search that had taken several years , wheeler was able to secure a premises for the institute of archaeology : st. john \\'s lodge in regent \\'s park , central london . left empty since its use as a hospital during the first world war , the building was owned by the crown and was controlled by the first commissioner of works , william ormsby @-@ gore ; he was very sympathetic to archaeology , and leased the building to the institute at a low rent . the st. john \\'s lodge premises were officially opened on 29 april 1937 . during his speech at the ceremony , the university of london \\'s vice @-@ chancellor charles reed peers made it clear that the building was only intended as a temporary home for the institute , which it was hoped would be able to move to bloomsbury , the city \\'s academic hub . in his speech , the university \\'s chancellor , alexander cambridge , 1st earl of athlone , compared the new institution to both the institute of historical research and the courtauld institute of art . \\n  wheeler had also become president of the museums association , and in a presidential address given in belfast talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in war time , believing that britain \\'s involvement in a second european conflict was imminent . in anticipation of this event , in august 1939 he arranged for the london museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping . he was also awarded an honorary doctorate from bristol university , and at the award ceremony met the conservative party politician winston churchill , who was then engaged in writing his multi @-@ volume a history of the english @-@ speaking peoples ; churchill asked wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval britain , to which the latter agreed . \\n  after maidan castle , wheeler turned his attention to france , where the archaeological investigation of iron age sites had lagged behind developments in britain . there , he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of leslie scott , beginning with a survey tour of brittany in the winter of 1936 – 37 . after this , wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at camp d \\'artus , near huelgoat , finistère . in addition to bringing many british archaeologists to work on the site , he hired six local breton workmen to assist the project , coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local iron age tribes to defend themselves from the roman invasion led by julius caesar . meanwhile , scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of kercaradec , near quimper . in july 1939 , the project focused its attention on normandy , with excavations beginning at the iron age hill forts of camp de canada and duclair . they were brought to an abrupt halt in september 1939 as the second world war broke out in europe , and the team evacuated back to britain . wheeler \\'s excavation report , co @-@ written with katherine richardson , was eventually published as hill @-@ forts of northern france in 1957 . \\n  = = = second world war : 1939 – 45 = = = \\n  wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with nazi germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities ; he believed that the united kingdom \\'s involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the munich agreement in september 1938 . volunteering for the armed services , he was assigned to assemble the 48th light anti @-@ aircraft battery at enfield , where he set about recruiting volunteers , including his son . as the 48th swelled in size , it was converted into the 42nd mobile light anti @-@ aircraft regiment in the royal artillery , which consisted of four batteries and was led by wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as commanding officer . given the nickname of \" flash alf \" by those serving under him , he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training . having been appointed secretary of the society of antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940 , he travelled to london to deal with society affairs on various occasions . in 1941 wheeler was awarded a fellowship of the british academy . cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named clive entwistle , who lambasted wheeler as \" that whiskered baboon \" . when wheeler discovered entwistle in bed with his wife , he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in march 1942 . \\n  in the summer of 1941 , wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against german and italian forces in the north african campaign . in september , they set sail from glasgow aboard the rms empress of russia ; because the mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces , they were forced to travel via the cape of good hope , before taking shore leave in durban . there , wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of iron age britain . the ship docked in aden , where wheeler and his men again took shore leave . they soon reached the british @-@ controlled suez , where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the great bitter lake . there , wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to jerusalem , where he visited petrie on his hospital deathbed . back in egypt , he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a wellington bomber on a bombing raid against axis forces , to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti @-@ aircraft battery . \\n  serving with the eighth army , wheeler was present in north africa when the axis armies pushed the allies back to el alamein . he was also part of the allied counter @-@ push , taking part in the second battle of el alamein and the advance on axis @-@ held tripoli . on the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of north africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces . after the british secured control of libya , wheeler visited tripoli and leptis magna , where he found that roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by british troops ; he brought about reforms to prevent this , lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology , making many monuments out @-@ of @-@ bounds , and ensuring that the royal air force changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a roman settlement . aware that the british were planning to invade and occupy the italian island of sicily , he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island . \\n  promoted to the rank of brigadier , after the german surrender in north africa , wheeler was sent to algiers where he was part of the staff committee planning the invasion of italy . there , he learned that the india office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed director general of archaeology in india . although he had never been to the country , he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of italy first . as intended , wheeler and his 12th anti @-@ aircraft brigade then took part in the invasion of sicily and then mainland italy , where they were ordered to use their anti @-@ aircraft guns to protect the british 10th corps . as the allies advanced north through italy , wheeler spent time in naples and then capri , where he met various aristocrats who had anti @-@ fascist sympathies . \\n  wheeler left italy in november 1943 and returned to london . there , he resigned as the director of the london museum and focused on organising the institute of archaeology , preparing it for its adoption of a new director , v. gordon childe , after the war . he also resigned as director of the society of antiquaries , but was appointed the group \\'s representative to the newly formed council for british archaeology . he developed a relationship with a woman named kim collingridge , and asked her to marry him . as she was a devout roman catholic , he officially converted to the religion , something which shocked many of his friends , who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith . he then set sail for bombay aboard a transport ship , the city of exeter , in february 1944 . \\n  = = = archaeological survey of india : 1944 – 48 = = = \\n  wheeler arrived in bombay in the spring of 1944 . there , he was welcomed by the city \\'s governor , john colville , before heading by train to delhi and then simla , where the headquarters of the archaeological survey of india were located . wheeler had been suggested for the job by archibald wavell , the viceroy of india , who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist leonard woolley , who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the british @-@ controlled subcontinent . wheeler recognised this state of affairs , in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment , commenting that \" we \\'re back in 1850 \" . he initially found much to dislike in india , and in his letters to friends in britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward indians : he stated that \" they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly ... i already find myself regarding them as ill @-@ made clockwork toys rather than as human beings , and i find myself bullying them most brutally . \" he expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle , and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them . \\n  from the beginning of his tenure , he sought to distance himself from previous director @-@ generals and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors . assigned with a four @-@ year contract , wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from britain , glyn daniel and stuart piggott , to aid him in reforming the archaeological survey , although they declined the offer . he then toured the subcontinent , seeking to meet all of the survey \\'s staff members . he had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the survey to focus on ; these included understanding the period between the bronze age indus valley civilization and the achaemenid empire , discerning the socio @-@ cultural background to the vedas , dating the aryan invasion , and establishing a dating system for southern india prior to the sixth century ce . during his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the archaeological survey , and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a national museum of archaeology , to be built in new delhi . \\n  in october 1944 , he opened his six @-@ month archaeological field school in taxila , where he instructed various students from across india in the methodologies of the discipline . wheeler became very fond of his students , with one of them , b. b. lal , later commenting that \" behind the gruff exterior , sir mortimer had a very kind and sympathetic heart \" . throughout his period in india , his students were some of the only individuals to whom wheeler warmed ; more widely , he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness , incompetence and corruption of indian society . initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent , wheeler was particularly fascinated by the bronze age indus valley civilization . on his initial inspection of the indus valley sites of mohenjo @-@ daro and harappa , he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements . he later led a more detailed excavation at harappa , where he exposed further fortifications and established a stratigraphy for the settlement . \\n  turning his attention to southern india , wheeler discovered remnants of a roman amphora in a museum , and began excavations at arikamedu , revealing a port from the first century ce which had traded in goods from the roman empire . the excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat , although it was during the excavation that world war ii ended ; in celebration , wheeler gave all his workers an extra rupee for the day . it has since been alleged that while wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site , it had previously been established by a. aiyappan , the superintendent of the government museum in madras , and the french archaeologist jouveau dubreuil , with wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution . he later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in brahmagiri , mysore , which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern india . \\n  wheeler established a new archaeological journal , ancient india , planning for it to be published twice a year . he had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays ; the first issue was released in january 1946 , and he would release three further volumes during his stay . wheeler married kim collingridge in simla , before he and his wife took part in an indian cultural mission to iran . the indian government had deemed wheeler ideal to lead the group , which departed via train to zahidan before visiting persepolis , tehran , isfahan , shiraz , pasargadae , and kashan . wheeler enjoyed the trip , and was envious of tehran \\'s archaeological museum and library , which was far in advance of anything then found in india . crossing into iraq , in baghdad the team caught a flight back to delhi . in 1946 , he was involved in a second cultural mission , this time to afghanistan , where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient bactria and visited the archaeology of balkh . \\n  wheeler was present during the 1947 partition of india into the dominion of pakistan and the union of india and the accompanying ethnic violence between hindu and muslim communities . he was unhappy with how these events had affected the archaeological survey , complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of pakistan and no longer able to work for him . he was based in new delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence , and attempted to help many of his muslim staff members escape from the hindu @-@ majority city unharmed . he further helped smuggle muslim families out of the city hospital , where they had taken refuge from a violent hindu mob . as india neared independence from the british empire , the political situation had changed significantly ; by october 1947 he was one of the last british individuals in a high @-@ up position within the country \\'s governing establishment , and recognised that many indian nationalists wanted him to also leave . \\n  as their relationship had become increasingly strained , his wife had left and returned to britain . although hoping to leave his post in india several months early , he was concerned for his economic prospects , and desperately searched for a new job position . through friends in the british archaeological community , he was offered a job as the secretary of the royal commission on ancient monuments for wales , although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down . instead , he agreed to take up a chair in the archaeology of the roman provinces at the institute of archaeology . in addition , the pakistani minister of education invited him to become the archaeological adviser to the pakistani government ; he agreed to also take up this position , on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three . \\n  = = later life = = \\n  = = = between britain and pakistan : 1948 – 52 = = = \\n  returning to london , wheeler moved into the hallam street flat where his son and daughter @-@ in @-@ law were living . wheeler and the latter disliked each other , and so in summer 1950 he moved out and began renting an apartment in mount street . a year later he moved into his wife \\'s house in mallord street , in an unsuccessful hope of reigniting their relationship . taking up his part @-@ time professorship at the institute of archaeology , he began to lecture to students almost every day . there , he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director , childe , despite their strong personal and professional differences . in april 1949 , after the retirement of cyril fox , wheeler was nominated for the presidency of the society of antiquaries , but lost to james mann ; many archaeologists , including childe and o. g. s. crawford , resigned from the society in protest , deeming wheeler to have been a far more appropriate candidate for the position . wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the society . in 1950 he was awarded the petrie medal , and in 1952 was knighted . that same year he was invited to give the norton lectures for the archaeological institute of america , and while in the united states was also awarded the lucy wharton drexel medal at pennsylvania . he nevertheless disliked the country , and in later life exhibited anti @-@ americanism . \\n  wheeler spent three months in pakistan during early 1949 , where he was engaged in organising the fledgling pakistani archaeological department with the aid of former members of the archaeological survey and new students whom he recruited . the minister of education , fazlur rahman , was sympathetic to wheeler \\'s plans , and the government agreed to establish a national museum of pakistan in karachi , which opened in april 1950 . wheeler himself was appointed the first president of the pakistani museums association , and found himself as a mediator in the arguments between india and pakistan over the redistribution of archaeological and historic artefacts following the partition . he also wrote a work of archaeological propaganda for the newly formed state , five thousand years of pakistan ( 1950 ) . \\n  to instruct new pakistani students in the methods of archaeology , in early 1950 wheeler ran a training excavation at mohenjo @-@ daro ; there , he was joined by the british student leslie alcock , who spoke both punjabi and urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by wheeler . this excavation proved to be the only one for which wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report . instead , he made reference to its findings in his book the indus civilization , published as part of the series the cambridge history of india . his relationship with the pakistani government had become strained , and so he declined to return to work for them for a third year . \\n  wheeler had been keen to return to excavation in britain . based on the one he had organised in india , wheeler developed an archaeological training course , which he ran at verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct british students in the methodologies of excavation . in summer 1950 , he was invited by the royal commission on historical monuments to direct a trial excavation at bindon hill in dorset . it was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday . he was invited by the ancient monuments department of the ministry of works to excavate the stanwick iron age fortifications in north riding , yorkshire , which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952 . aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the british archaeological scene , he was joined by alcock and alcock \\'s wife , among others . wheeler published his report on the site in 1954 . \\n  in 1949 wheeler was appointed honorary secretary of the british academy after frederic g. kenyon stepped down from the position . according to piggott , the institution had \" unhappily drifted into senility without the excuse of being venerable \" , and wheeler devoted much time attempting to revitalise the organisation and ensured that charles webster was appointed president . together , wheeler and webster sought to increase the number of younger members of the academy , increasing the number of fellows who were permitted to join and proposing that those over 75 years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation \\'s council ; this latter measure was highly controversial , and though defeated in 1951 , wheeler and webster were able to push it through in 1952 . in doing so , piggott stated , wheeler helped rid the society of its \" self @-@ perpetuating gerontocracy \" . to aid him in these projects , wheeler employed a personal assistant , molly myers , who remained with him for the rest of his life . \\n  = = = popular fame : 1952 – 69 = = = \\n  in 1956 , wheeler retired from his part @-@ time professorship at the institute of archaeology . childe was also retiring from his position of director that year , and wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him . wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of w.f. grimes , deeming his career undistinguished ; instead , he championed glyn daniel as a candidate , although ultimately grimes was selected . that year , wheeler \\'s marriage broke down , and he moved from his wife \\'s house to a former brothel at 27 whitcomb street in central london . from 1954 to 1959 , he served as the president of the society of antiquaries , and after resigning supported ian richmond as his replacement ; however , joan evans was selected . from 1964 to 1966 he served as chairman of the ancient monuments board , stepping down when he concluded that he was too old for the role . in december 1963 , wheeler underwent a prostate operation that went wrong , and was hospitalised for over a month . in november 1967 , wheeler became a companion of honour , and in 1968 he became a fellow of the royal society . \\n  = = = = media fame and public archaeology = = = = \\n  wheeler became famous in britain as \" the embodiment of popular archaeology through the medium of television \" . in 1952 , wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new bbc television series , animal , vegetable , mineral ? . based on the american quiz programme what in the world ? , the show was hosted by glyn daniel and featured three experts in archaeology , anthropology , and natural history being asked to identify artefacts which had been selected from various museums . however , wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display . the show proved popular with british audiences , and would air for six more years . it brought wheeler to public attention , resulting in a television personality of the year award for him in 1954 . he also appeared in an episode of buried treasure , an archaeology show also hosted by daniel , in which the pair travelled to denmark to discuss tollund man . in 1957 , he appeared in a second episode of buried treasure , for which he travelled to pakistan to discuss that nation \\'s archaeology , and in 1958 again appeared in an episode , this time on the site of great zimbabwe in southern rhodesia . in 1959 he presented his own three @-@ part series on the grandeur that was rome , for which he travelled to hadrian \\'s wall , pompeii , and leptis magna ; the show failed to secure high ratings , and was wheeler \\'s last major foray into television . meanwhile , he also made appearances on bbc radio , initially featuring on the john irving series the archaeologist , but later presenting his own eight @-@ part series on roman britain and also appearing on the series asian club , which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the indian subcontinent . \\n  from 1954 onward , wheeler began to devote an increasing amount of his time to encouraging greater public interest in archaeology , and it was in that year that he obtained an agent . oxford university press also published two of his books in 1954 . the first was a book on archaeological methodologies , archaeology from the earth , which was translated into various languages . the second was rome beyond the imperial frontier , discussing evidence for roman activity at sites like arikamedu and segontium . in 1955 wheeler released his episodic autobiography , still digging , which had sold over 70 @,@ 000 copies by the end of the year . in 1959 , wheeler wrote early india and pakistan , which was published as part as daniel \\'s \" ancient peoples and places \" series for thames and hudson ; as with many earlier books , he was criticised for rushing to conclusions . \\n  he authored the section entitled \" ancient india \" for piggott \\'s edited volume the dawn of civilisation , which was published by thames and hudson in 1961 , before writing an introduction for roger wood \\'s photography book roman africa in colour , which was also published by thames and hudson . he then agreed to edit a series for the publisher , known as \" new aspects of antiquity \" , through which they released a variety of archaeological works . the rival publisher weidenfeld & nicolson had also persuaded wheeler to work for them , securing him to write many sections of their book , splendours of the east . they also published his 1968 book flames over persopolis , in which wheeler discussed persopolis and the persian empire in the year that it was conquered by alexander the great . \\n  in 1954 , the tour company r.k. swan invited wheeler to provide lectures on the archaeology of ancient greece aboard their hellenic cruise line , which he did in 1955 . in 1957 , he then gave a guided tour of the archaeology of the indian subcontinent for the rival tour company fairways and swinford . after swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their hellenic cruise division , he made two fortnight tours a year , in spring and summer . in late 1969 he conducted the swans tour to the indian subcontinent , visiting the south and east of the republic as well as ceylon . during this period , wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in india and pakistan , helping to secure them work and funding where possible . \\n  wheeler had continued his archaeological investigations , and in 1954 led an expedition to the somme and pas de calais where he sought to obtain more information on the french iron age to supplement that gathered in the late 1930s . pakistan \\'s ministry of education invited wheeler to return to their country in october 1956 . here , he undertook test excavations at charsada to determine a chronology of the site . in 1965 , he agreed to take on the position of president of the camelot research committee , which had been established to promote the findings of excavations at cadbury castle in somerset run by his friends ralegh radford and alcock ; the project ended in 1970 . he also agreed to sit as chairman of the archaeological committee overseeing excavations at york minster , work which occupied him into the 1970s . wheeler had also continued his work with museums , campaigning for greater state funding for them . while he had become a trustee of the institution in 1963 , he achieved publicity for vocally criticising the british museum as \" a mountainous corpse \" , lambasting it as being poorly managed and overcrowded with artefacts . the bbc staged a public debate with the museum director frank francis . \\n  = = = = british academy and unesco = = = = \\n  as honorary secretary of the british academy , wheeler focused on increasing the organisation \\'s revenues , thus enabling it to expand its remit . he developed personal relationships with various employees at the british treasury , and offered the academy \\'s services as an intermediary in dealing with the egypt exploration society , the british school at athens , the british school at rome , the british school at ankara , the british school in iraq , and the british school at jerusalem , all of which were then directly funded independently by the treasury . accepting this offer , the treasury agreed to double its funding of the academy to £ 5 @,@ 000 a year . approaching various charitable foundations , from 1955 wheeler also secured funding from both the pilgrim trust and the nuffield foundation , and in 1957 then secured additional funding from the rockefeller foundation . \\n  with this additional money , the academy was able to organise a survey of the state of the humanities and social sciences in the united kingdom , authoring a report that was published by oxford university press in 1961 as research in the humanities and the social sciences . on the basis of this report , wheeler was able to secure a dramatic rise in funding from the british treasury ; they increased their annual grant to £ 25 @,@ 000 , and promised that this would increase to £ 50 @,@ 000 shortly after . according to his later biographer jacquetta hawkes , in doing so wheeler raised the position of the academy to that of \" the main source of official patronage for the humanities \" within the united kingdom , while piggott stated that he set the organisation upon its \" modern course \" . \\n  to improve britain \\'s cultural influence abroad , wheeler had been urging the establishment of a british institute of history and archaeology in east africa , touring east africa itself in august 1955 . in 1956 the academy requested £ 6 @,@ 000 from the treasury to fund this new institution , to which they eventually agreed in 1959 . the institute was initially established in dar es salaam in 1961 , although later relocated to nairobi . meanwhile , wheeler had also been campaigning for the establishment of a british institute of persian studies , a project which was supported by the british embassy in tehran ; they hoped that it would rival the successful french institute in the city . in 1960 , the treasury agreed , with the new institution being housed on the premises of the university of tehran . he further campaigned for the establishment of a british institute in japan , although these ideas were scrapped amid the british financial crisis of 1967 . \\n  wheeler retained an active interest in the running of these british institutions abroad ; in 1967 he visited the british school in jerusalem amid the six @-@ day war between israel and its arab neighbours , and in january 1968 visited the persian institute with the archaeologist max mallowan and mallowan \\'s wife agatha christie , there inspecting the excavations at siraf . in 1969 he proceeded to the italian city of rome to inspect the british school there . that year , he resigned as honorary secretary of the academy . the position became a salaried , professional one , with the numismatist derek allen taking on the position . \\n  recognising his stature within the archaeological establishment , the government appointed wheeler as the british representative on a unesco project to undertake a programme of rescue archaeology in the nile valley ahead of the construction of the aswan dam , which was going to flood large areas of egypt and sudan . personally securing uk funding for the project , he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the british government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the abu simbel temples . in october 1968 , he took part in a unesco visit to pakistan to assess the state of mohenjo @-@ daro , writing the project \\'s report on how the archaeological site could best be preserved . his involvement with unesco continued for the rest of his life , and in march 1973 he was invited to the organisation \\'s conference in paris . \\n  = = = final years : 1970 – 76 = = = \\n  during his final years , wheeler remained involved in various activities , for instance sitting on the advisory panel of the antiquity journal and the management committee of the royal archaeological institute . in march 1971 , the archaeologist barry cunliffe and a number of his undergraduate students at the university of southampton organised a conference on the subject of \" the iron age and its hillforts \" to celebrate wheeler \\'s eightieth birthday . wheeler attended the event , whose conference proceedings were published as a festschrift for the octogenarian . in spring 1973 , wheeler returned to bbc television for two episodes of the archaeology @-@ themed series chronicle in which he discussed his life and career . the episodes were well received , and wheeler became a close friend of the show \\'s producer , david collison . \\n  in the 1970s , wheeler became increasingly forgetful and came to rely largely on his assistant , molly myres , to organise his affairs . amid increasing ill health , in september 1973 he moved full @-@ time into myres \\'s house in leatherhead , surrey , although he continued to use his central london flat during day @-@ trips to the city . there , he authored a final book , my archaeological mission to india and pakistan , although much of the text was culled from his previous publications ; it was published by thames and hudson in 1976 . after suffering a stroke , wheeler died at myers \\' home on 22 july 1976 . in memoriam , the british academy , royal academy , and royal society flew their flags at half @-@ mast . wheeler \\'s funeral was held with military trappings at a local crematorium , while a larger memorial service was held in st james \\'s church , piccadilly in november . \\n  = = personal life = = \\n  wheeler was known as \" rik \" among friends . he divided opinion among those who knew him , with some loving and others despising him , and during his lifetime he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds . the archaeologist max mallowan asserted that he \" was a delightful , light @-@ hearted and amusing companion , but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration \" . his charm offensives were often condemned as being insincere . during excavations , he was known as an authoritarian leader , but favoured those whom he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority . hence , he has been termed \" a benevolent dictator \" . he was meticulous in his writings , and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters . throughout his life , he was a heavy smoker . \\n  wheeler expressed the view that he was \" the least political of mortals \" . despite not taking a strong interest in politics , wheeler was described by his biographer as \" a natural conservative \" ; for instance , during his youth he was strongly critical of the suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women . nevertheless , he was \" usually happy to advance young women professionally \" , something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them . he expressed little interest in his relatives ; in later life he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties . \\n  wheeler was married three times . in may 1914 , wheeler married tessa verney . tessa became an accomplished archaeologist , and they collaborated until she died in 1936 . their only child , a son michael , was born in january 1915 ; he became a barrister . following tessa \\'s death , in 1939 , wheeler married mavis de vere cole , although their relationship was strained ; cole \\'s diaries revealed that wheeler physically hit her when she annoyed him . in 1945 mortimer wheeler married his third wife , margaret \" kim \" collingridge , although they became estranged in 1956 ; they never divorced as a result of her devout catholicism . meanwhile , wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity , favouring young women for one night stands , many of whom were his students . he was further known for having casual sex in public places . this behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and mistresses , of which he was aware . as a result of this behaviour , later archaeologist gabriel moshenska informed a reporter from the daily mail that wheeler had developed a reputation as \" a bit of a groper and a sex pest and an incredible bully as well \" . \\n  = = reception and legacy = = \\n  wheeler has been termed \" the most famous british archaeologist of the twentieth century \" by archaeologists gabriel moshenska and tim schadla @-@ hall . highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout british society , they stated that his \" mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a showman \\'s willingness to package and sell the past \" . this was an issue about which wheeler felt very strongly ; writing his obituary for the biographical memoirs of fellows of the royal society , the english archaeologist stuart piggott noted that wheeler placed \" great importance to the archaeologist \\'s obligation to the public , on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended . \" \\n  piggott believed that wheeler \\'s greatest impact was as \" the great innovator in field techniques \" , comparing him in this respect to pitt @-@ rivers . piggott stated that the \" importance of wheeler \\'s contribution to archaeological technique , enormous and far @-@ reaching , lies in the fact that in the early 1920s he not only appreciated and understood what pitt @-@ rivers had done , but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation , development and improvement . \" l. c. carr stated that it was for his methodological developments , oft termed \" the wheeler method \" , that wheeler was best known ; in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site , such as arthur evans and knossos or leonard woolley and ur . \\n  wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters ; carr stated that both wheeler and his first wife emphasised \" technical rigour and a full presentation of materials unearthed , as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience . \" focusing on wheeler \\'s publications regarding south asian archaeology , sudeshna guha noted that he \" produced an assemblage of image @-@ objects that embodied the precision he demanded from excavation photography . \" mallowan noted that \" immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship , although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod . \" jacquetta hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was \" sometimes too sure of being right , too ready to accept his own authority \" . she asserted that while wheeler was not an original thinker , he had \" a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces , however small , in its widest significance . \" \\n  piggott claimed that wheeler \\'s appointment as director @-@ general of the archaeological survey of india represented \" the most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career , an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in the autocratic and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and excavator . no other archaeologist of the time , it seems fair to remark , could have come near to attaining his command of incisive strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him the bewildered admiration and touching devotion of his indian staff . \" the indian archaeologist dilip k. chakrabarti later stated that wheeler \\'s accomplishments while in india were \" considerable \" , particularly given the socio @-@ political turmoil of independence and partition . chakrabarti stated that wheeler had contributed to south asian archaeology in various ways : by establishing a \" total view \" of the region \\'s development from the palaeolithic onward , by introducing new archaeological techniques and methodologies to the subcontinent , and by encouraging indian universities to begin archaeological research . ultimately , chakrabarti was of the opinion that wheeler had \" prepared the archaeology of the subcontinent for its transition to modernity in the post @-@ partition period . \" similarly , peter johansen praised wheeler for systematising and professionalising indian archaeology and for \" instituting a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training . \" \\n  on wheeler \\'s death , h.d. sankalia of deccan college , pune , described him as \" well known among old world archaeologists in the united states \" , particularly for his book archaeology from the earth and his studies of the indus valley civilisation . in its 2013 obituary of the english archaeologist mick aston , british archaeology magazine – the publication of the council for british archaeology – described aston as \" the mortimer wheeler of our times \" because despite the strong differences between their personalities , both had done much to bring archaeology to the british public . however , writing in 2011 , moshenska and schadla @-@ hall asserted that wheeler \\'s reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists , but that instead he had come to be remembered as \" a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure \" whom they termed \" naughty morty \" . carr described the institute of archaeology as \" one of the [ wheeler ] couple \\'s most permanent memorials . \" \\n  = = = biographies and studies = = = \\n  in 1960 , ronald william clark published a biography titled sir mortimer wheeler . fitzroy somerset , 4th baron raglan reviewed the volume for the journal man , describing \" this very readable little book \" as being \" adulatory \" in tone , \" but hardly more so than its subject deserves . \" in 1982 , the archaeologist jacquetta hawkes published a second biography , mortimer wheeler : adventurer in archaeology . hawkes admitted she had developed \" a very great liking \" for wheeler , having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the university of cambridge . she believed that he had \" a daemonic energy \" , with his accomplishments in india being \" almost superhuman \" . ultimately , she thought of him as being \" an epic hero in an anti @-@ heroic age \" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness . \\n  in the 2000 film hey ram , the lead character , saket ram ( played by kamal haasan ) and his friend , amjad khan ( played by shah rukh khan ) are shown as employees of wheeler , who was portrayed by lewis k. elbinger , before the 1947 hindu @-@ muslim riots . in a 2003 volume of the south asian studies journal , sudeshna gusha published a research article examining wheeler \\'s use of photography in his excavations and publications in the indian subcontinent . in 2011 , the academic journal public archaeology published a research paper by moshenska and schadla @-@ hall that analysed wheeler \\'s role in presenting archaeology to the british public . two years later , the papers from the institute of archaeology issued a short comic strip by moshenska and alex salamunovich depicting wheeler \\'s activities in studying the archaeology of libya during world war ii . \\n  = species of allosaurus = \\n  there have been a number of potential species assigned to the carnosaurian dinosaur genus allosaurus since its description in 1877 by othniel charles marsh , but only a handful are still regarded as valid . allosaurus was originally described from material from the upper jurassic morrison formation of the western united states of america ; the type species a. fragilis became one of the best @-@ known species of dinosaur . \\n  the genus allosaurus was part of the marsh / cope \" bone wars \" of the late 19th century , and its taxonomy became increasingly confused due to the competition , with several genera and species named by cope and marsh now regarded as synonyms of allosaurus or a. fragilis . since the description of allosaurus , scientists have proposed additional species from such far @-@ flung locales as portugal , siberia , and tanzania . \\n  = = query about type specimen = = \\n  the issue of synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of allosaurus fragillis ( catalogue number ypm 1930 ) being extremely fragmentary , consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae , limb bone fragments , rib fragments , and a tooth . because of this , several scientists have noted that the type specimen , and thus the genus allosaurus itself or at least the species a. fragillis , is technically a nomen dubium ( \" dubious name \" , based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify ) . in an attempt to fix this situation , gregory s. paul and kenneth carpenter ( 2010 ) submitted a petition to the iczn to have the name a. fragillis officially transferred to the more complete specimen usnm4734 ( as a neotype ) . this request is currently pending review . \\n  = = potentially valid species = = \\n  it is unclear how many species of allosaurus there were . eight species have been considered potentially valid since 1988 ( a. amplexus , a. atrox , a. europaeus , the type species a. fragilis , the as @-@ yet not formally described \" a. jimmadseni \" , a. lucasi , a. maximus , and a. tendagurensis ) , although only about half are usually considered valid at any given time . there are also at least ten dubious or undescribed species that have been assigned to allosaurus over the years , along with the species belonging to genera now sunk into allosaurus . in the most recent review of basal tetanuran theropods , only a. fragilis ( including a. amplexus and a. atrox ) , \" a. jimmadseni \" ( as an unnamed species ) , and a. tendagurensis were accepted as potentially valid species , with a. europaeus not yet proposed and a. maximus assigned to saurophaganax . \\n  a. fragilis is the type species and was named by marsh in 1877 . it is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals , all found in the kimmeridgian – tithonian upper jurassic @-@ age morrison formation of the united states , spread across the states of colorado , montana , new mexico , oklahoma , south dakota , utah , and wyoming . details of the humerus ( upper arm ) of a. fragilis have been used as diagnostic among morrison theropods , but the discovery of \" a. jimmadseni \" indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level . \\n  a. amplexus was named by gregory s. paul for giant morrison allosaur remains , and included in his conception saurophagus maximus ( later saurophaganax ) . a. amplexus was originally coined by cope in 1878 as the type species of his new genus epanterias , and is based on what is now amnh 5767 , parts of three vertebrae , a coracoid , and a metatarsal . following paul \\'s work , this species has been accepted as a synonym of a. fragilis . \\n  allosaurus material from portugal was first reported in 1999 on the basis of mhnul / and.001 , a partial skeleton including a quadrate , vertebrae , ribs , gastralia , chevrons , part of the hips , and hindlimbs . this specimen was assigned to a. fragilis , but the subsequent discovery of a partial skull and neck ( ml 415 ) near lourinhã , in the kimmeridgian @-@ age porto novo member of the lourinhã formation , spurred the naming of the new species a. europaeus . it differs from other species of allosaurus in cranial details . however , more material may show it to be a. fragilis , as originally described . \\n  daniel chure \\'s work on morrison allosaurid remains has been responsible , directly or indirectly , for \" a. jimmadseni \" and a. maximus . \" a. jimmadseni \" is the proposed name for a new species of morrison allosaur , based on a nearly complete skeleton and skull . a. sp . 2 , as it is also known , differs from a. fragilis in several anatomical details including a jugal or cheekbone with a straight lower margin , and is also found only in the salt wash member of the morrison formation , with a. fragilis only present in the higher brushy basin member . a. maximus was coined by david k. smith for chure \\'s saurophaganax maximus , a taxon created by chure in 1995 for giant allosaurid remains from the morrison of oklahoma . these remains had been known as saurophagus , but that name was already in use , leading chure to propose a substitute . smith , in his 1998 analysis of variation , concluded that s. maximus was not different enough from allosaurus to be a separate genus , but did warrant its own species , a. maximus . this reassignment was rejected in the most recent review of basal tetanurans . \\n  = = biological variation , a. atrox , and a. fragilis = = \\n  the perception that there were two common allosaurus species in the morrison formation was popularized in gregory s. paul \\'s 1988 book predatory dinosaurs of the world . paul proposed that a. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species a. atrox , and was not a different gender due to rarity . allosaurus atrox was originally named by marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus , creosaurus , and is based on ypm 1890 , an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull , portions of nine tail vertebrae , two hip vertebrae , an illium , and ankle and foot bones . although the idea of two common morrison allosaur species has had support in semi @-@ technical and popular works , it has generally been rejected in the technical literature . \\n  david k. smith , examining allosaurus fossils by quarry , found that the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry ( utah ) specimens are generally smaller than those from como bluff ( wyoming ) or brigham young university \\'s dry mesa quarry ( colorado ) , but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites . a later study by smith incorporating garden park ( colorado ) and dinosaur national monument ( utah ) specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation ; skull variation was most common and was gradational , suggesting individual variation was responsible . further work on size @-@ related variation again found no consistent differences , although the dry mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus , an ankle bone . kenneth carpenter , using skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site , found wide variation between individuals , calling into question previous species @-@ level distinctions based such features as the shape of the horns , and the proposed differentiation of \" a. jimmadseni \" based on the shape of the jugal . \\n  = = invalid and synonymous species = = \\n  a number of species assigned to allosaurus are no longer recognized as valid , for one reason or another . species \" a. agilis \" , seen in zittel , 1887 , and osborn , 1912 , is a typographical error for a. fragilis . marsh \\'s a. ferox ( 1896 ; not to be confused with his 1884 labrosaurus ferox , also part of allosaurus taxonomy ) was coined for a partial skull in a footnote , and has been recognized as a specimen of a fragilis . a. lucaris , another marsh name , was given to a partial skeleton in 1878 . he later decided it warranted its own genus , labrosaurus , but this has not been accepted , and a. lucaris is also regarded as another specimen of a. fragilis . allosaurus lucaris , is known mostly from vertebrae , sharing characters with allosaurus . paul and carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species , ypm 1931 , was from a younger age than allosaurus , and might represent a different genus . however , they found that the specimen was undiagnostic , and thus a. lucaris was a nomen dubium . \" a. whitei \" , an informally described species coined by pickering in 1996 , is a recasting of the a. atrox versus a. fragilis debate using a better specimen to represent the a. atrox form , and has not been recognized . \\n  several species coined in genera other than allosaurus are also now thought to be synonymous with a. fragilis . labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw , with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw , and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down . later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic , showing an injury to the living animal , and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction . it is recognized as most likely a specimen of a. fragilis . allosaurus valens is a typo for antrodemus valens accidentally used by friedrich von huene in 1932 ; antrodemus valens itself may also pertain to allosaurus fragilis , as gilmore suggested in 1920 . apatodon mirus , based on a scrap of vertebra marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw , may or may not be the same as allosaurus . \\n  = = misassigned species = = \\n  several species initially classified within or referred to allosaurus do not belong within the genus . a. medius was named by marsh in 1888 for \" various specimens \" from the early cretaceous of maryland , although most of the remains were removed by richard swann lull to the new ornithopod species dryosaurus grandis , except for a tooth . gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to a new species , dryptosaurus medius . the referral was not accepted in the most recent review , and allosaurus medius was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod . allosaurus sibiricus was described in 1914 by a. n. riabinin on the basis of a bone , later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal , from the early cretaceous of buryatia , russia . it was transferred to chilantaisaurus in 1990 . \\n  allosaurus meriani was described in 1870 by greppin as a species of megalosaurus , based on a tooth from the late jurassic of switzerland . it has occasionally been referred to allosaurus , but recent reviews have listed it as dubious theropod species megalosaurus meriani , or included it in ceratosaurus sp . allosaurus stechowi was described in 1920 by janensch as labrosaurus stechowi for isolated ceratosaurus @-@ like teeth from the tendaguru beds of tanzania . with the synonymization of labrosaurus and allosaurus , donald f. glut listed it as a species of allosaurus , but it is now either assigned to ceratosaurus sp. or considered a dubious ceratosaurian . \\n  there are also several species left over from the synonymizations of creosaurus and labrosaurus with allosaurus . creosaurus potens was named by lull in 1911 for a vertebra from the early cretaceous of maryland . it is now regarded as a dubious theropod . labrosaurus fragilis is a typographical error by marsh ( 1896 ) for labrosaurus ferox . l. sulcatus , named by marsh in 1896 for a morrison theropod tooth , which like l. stechowi is now regarded as either ceratosaurus sp. or a dubious ceratosaurian . \\n  a. tendagurensis was named in 1925 by werner janensch for a partial shin ( hm 67 ) found in the kimmeridgian @-@ age rocks of tendaguru , in mtwara , tanzania . this species has not had strong support in recent years , with opinions on its identity ranging from a tentatively valid species of allosaurus , to a basal tetanuran . the most recent analysis has placed it in carcharodontosauridae . although obscure , it was a large theropod , possibly around 10 meters long ( 33 ft ) and 2 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 2 @.@ 8 short tons ) in weight . \\n  = = specimens misassigned to allosaurus though not described as new species = = \\n  kurzanov and colleagues in 2003 designated six teeth from siberia as allosaurus sp . ( meaning the authors found the specimens to be most like those of allosaurus , but did not or could not assign a species ) . also , reports of allosaurus in shanxi , china go back to at least 1982 . \\n  an astragalus ( ankle bone ) thought to belong to a species of allosaurus was found at cape paterson , victoria in early cretaceous beds in southeastern australia . it was thought to provide evidence that australia was a refugium for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere . this identification was challenged by samuel welles , who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid , but the original authors defended their identification . with fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at , daniel chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not allosaurus , but could represent an allosauroid . similarly , yoichi azuma and phil currie , in their description of fukuiraptor , noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus . this specimen is sometimes referred to as \" allosaurus robustus \" , an informal museum name . it may have belonged to something similar to , or the same as , australovenator , or it may represent an abelisaur . a speculative \" polar \" or \" dwarf allosaur \" was used for the \" spirits of the ice forest \" episode of walking with dinosaurs . \\n  = astraeus hygrometricus = \\n  astraeus hygrometricus , commonly known as the hygroscopic earthstar , the barometer earthstar , or the false earthstar , is a species of fungus in the diplocystaceae family . young specimens resemble a puffball when young and unopened . in maturity , the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that is a result of the outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star @-@ like manner . the false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees , especially in sandy soils . a. hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution , and is common in temperate and tropical regions . its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic ( water @-@ absorbing ) , and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity , and close them up again in drier conditions . the rays have an irregularly cracked surface , while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top . the gleba is white initially , but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature . the spores are reddish @-@ brown , roughly spherical with minute warts , measuring 7 @.@ 5 – 11 micrometers in diameter . \\n  despite a similar overall appearance , a. hygrometricus is not related to the true earthstars of genus geastrum , although historically , they have been taxonomically confused . the species was first described by christiaan hendrik persoon in 1801 as geastrum hygrometricus . in 1885 , andrew p. morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted the creation of a new genus astraeus distinct from geastrum ; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities . several asian populations formerly thought to be a. hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique astraeus species , including a. asiaticus and a. odoratus . research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies . north american field guides typically rate a. hygrometricus as inedible . \\n  = = taxonomy , naming , and phylogeny = = \\n  because this species resembles the earthstar fungi of geastrum , it was placed in that genus by early authors , starting with christian hendrik persoon in 1801 ( as geaster , an alternate spelling of geastrum ) . according to the american botanist andrew p. morgan , however , the species differed from those of geastrum in not having open chambers in the young gleba , having larger and branched capillitium threads , not having a true hymenium , and having larger spores . accordingly , morgan set persoon \\'s geaster hygrometricum as the type species of his new genus astraeus in 1889 . despite morgan \\'s publication , some authorities in the following decades continued to classify the species in geastrum . the new @-@ zealand based mycologist gordon herriot cunningham explicitly transferred the species back to the genus geastrum in 1944 , explaining : \\n  the treatment of this species by certain taxonomists well illustrates the pitfalls that lie in wait for those who worship at the shrine of ontogenic classification ... the only feature of those outlined in which the species differs from others of geastrum is the somewhat primitive hymenium . in the developing plant the glebal cavities are separated by tramal plates so tenuous as to be overlooked by the uncritical worker . each cavity is filled with basidia somewhat irregularly arranged in clusters ( like those of scleroderma ) and not in the definite palisade of the species which have been studied . this difference disappears as maturity is reached , when plants resemble closely the fructification of any other member of the genus . the taxonomist is then unable to indicate any point of difference by which \" astraeus \" may be separated from geastrum , which indicates that the name should be discarded . \\n  cunningham \\'s treatment was not followed by later authorities , who largely considered astraeus a distinct genus . according to the taxonomical authority mycobank , synonyms of astraeus hygrometricus include lycoperdon stellatus scop . ( 1772 ) ; geastrum fibrillosum schwein . ( 1822 ) ; geastrum stellatum ( scop . ) wettst . ( 1885 ) ; and astraeus stellatus e.fisch. ( 1900 ) . \\n  astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of colloquial names that allude to its hygroscopic behavior , including the \" hygrometer earthstar \" , the \" hygroscopic earthstar \" , the \" barometer earthstar \" , and the \" water @-@ measure earthstar \" . the resemblance to geastrum species ( also known as true earthstars ) accounts for the common name \" false earthstar \" . the specific name is derived from the greek words ὑγρός ( hygros ) \" wet \" and μέτρον ( metron ) \" measure \" . the german mycological society selected the species as their \" mushroom of the year \" in 2005 . \\n  studies in the 2000s showed that several species from asian collection sites labelled under the specific epithet hygrometricus were actually considerably variable in a number of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics . molecular studies of the dna sequences of the its region of the ribosomal dna from a number of astraeus specimens from around the world have helped to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the genus . based on these results , two asian \" hygrometricus \" populations have been described as new species : a. asiaticus and a. odoratus ( synonymous with petcharat \\'s a. thailandicus described in 2003 ) . preliminary dna analyses suggests that the european a. hygrometricus described by persoon is a different species than the north american version described by morgan , and that the european population may be divided into two distinct phylotypes , from france and from the mediterranean . a 2010 study identified a japanese species , previously identified as a. hygrometricus , as genetically distinct ; it has yet to be officially named . \\n  a form of the species found in korea and japan , a. hygrometricus var. koreanus , was named by v.j. stanĕk in 1958 ; it was later ( 1976 ) published as a distinct species — a. koreanus — by hanns kreisel . as pointed out by fangfuk and colleagues , clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of a. hygrometricus var. koreanus specimens from the type locality in north korea . \\n  = = description = = \\n  young specimens of a. hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially embedded in the substrate . a smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body , and may be partially encrusted with debris . as the fruit body matures , the mycelial layer tears away , and the outer tissue layer , the exoperidium , breaks open in a star @-@ shaped ( stellate ) pattern to form 4 – 20 irregular \" rays \" . this simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium . the rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment , opening up in high humidity , and closing when the air is dry . this is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue ; the innermost , fibrous layer is hygroscopic , and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings . this adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture , and reduce evaporation during dry periods . further , dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind , allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll . \\n  the fruit body is 1 – 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter from tip to tip when expanded . the exoperidium is thick , and the rays are typically areolate ( divided into small areas by cracks and crevices ) on the upper surface , and are dark grey to black . the spore case is sessile ( lacking a stalk ) , light gray to tan color and 1 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) broad with a felt @-@ like or scurfy ( coated with loose scaly crust ) surface ; the top of the spore case is opened by an irregular slit , tear or pore . the interior of the spore case , the gleba , is white and solid when young , and divided into oval locules — a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from geastrum . the gleba becomes brown and powdery as the specimen matures . small dark hairlike threads ( rhizomorphs ) extend from the base of the fruit body into the substrate . the rhizomorphs are fragile , and often break off after maturity . \\n  the spores are spherical or nearly so , reddish @-@ brown , thick @-@ walled and verrucose ( covered with warts and spines ) . the spores \\' dimensions are 7 – 11 µm ; the warts are about 1 µm long . the spores are non @-@ amyloid , and will not stain with iodine from melzer \\'s reagent . the use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are 0 @.@ 90 – 1 @.@ 45 µm long , rounded at the tip , narrow , tapered , and sometime joined together at the top . the capillitia ( masses of thread @-@ like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores ) are branched , 3 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 µm in diameter , and hyaline ( translucent ) . the basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four- to eight @-@ spored , with very short sterigmata . the basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters ; individual basidia measure 11 – 15 by 18 – 24 µm . the threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium , and are thick @-@ walled , long , interwoven , and branched , measuring 3 – 5 @.@ 5 µm thick . the exoperidium ( the outer layer of tissue , comprising the rays ) is made of four distinct layers of tissue : the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4 – 6 μm in diameter ; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6 – 8 μm diameter and branched ; the collenchyma @-@ type layer has branched hyphae of 3 – 4 μm diameter ; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3 – 6 μm in diameter . \\n  = = = edibility = = = \\n  north american sources describe a. hygrometricus as being of either unknown edibility , or too tough to be edible . however , they are regularly consumed in asia , including nepal and south bengal , where \" local people consume them as delicious food \" . they are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of india . \\n  a study of a closely related southeast asian astraeus species concluded that the fungus contained an abundance of volatile eight @-@ carbon compounds ( including 1 @-@ octanol , 1 @-@ octen @-@ 3 @-@ ol , and 1 @-@ octen @-@ 3 @-@ one ) that imparted a \" mushroom @-@ like , earthy , and pungent odor that was evident as an oily and moss @-@ like smell upon opening the caps \" . the study \\'s authors further noted that the fruit bodies after cooking have a \" roasted , maillard , herbal , and oily flavor \" . volatile compounds detected after cooking the mushroom samples included furfural , benzaldehyde , cyclohexenone , and furanyl compounds . the regional differences in opinions on edibility are from sources published before it was known that north american and asian versions of a. hygrometricus were not always the same ; in some cases asian specimens have been identified as new species , such as a. asiaticus and a. odoratus . \\n  = = similar species = = \\n  although a. hygrometricus bears a superficial resemblance to member of the \" true earthstars \" geastrum , it may be readily differentiated from most by the hygroscopic nature of its rays . hygroscopic earthstars include g. arenarium , g. corollinum , g. floriforme , g. recolligens , and g. kotlabae . unlike geastrum , the young fruit bodies of a. hygrometricus do not have a columella ( sterile tissue in the gleba , at the base of the spore sac ) . geastrum tends to have its spore sac opening surrounded by a peristome or a disc , in contrast with the single lacerate slit of a. hygrometricus . there are also several microscopic differences : in a. hygrometricus , the basidia are not arranged in parallel columns , the spores are larger , and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the hyphae of the peridium . despite these differences , older specimens can be difficult to distinguish from geastrum in the field . one species of geastrum , g. mammosum , does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic , and could be confused with a. hygrometricus ; however , its spores are smaller than a. hygrometricus , typically about 4 µm in diameter . \\n  astraeus pteridis is larger , 5 to 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) or more when expanded , and often has a more pronounced areolate pattern on the inner surface of the rays . it is found in north america and the canary islands . a. asiaticus and a. odoratus are two similar species known from throughout asia and southeast asia , respectively . a. odoratus is distinguished from a. hygrometricus by a smooth outer mycelial layer with few adhering soil particles , 3 – 9 broad rays , and a fresh odor similar to moist soil . the spore ornamentation of a. odoratus is also distinct from a. hygrometricus , with longer and narrower spines that often joined together . a. asiaticus has an outer peridial surface covered with small granules , and a gleba that is purplish @-@ chestnut in color , compared to the smooth peridial surface and brownish gleba of a. hygrometricus . the upper limit of the spore size of a. asiaticus is larger than that of its more common relative , ranging from 8 @.@ 75 – 15 @.@ 2 μm . a. koreanus ( sometimes named as the variety a. hygrometricus var. koreanus ; see taxonomy ) differs from the more common form in its smaller size , paler fruit body , and greater number of rays ; microscopically , it has smaller spores ( between 6 @.@ 8 and 9 μm in diameter ) , and the spines on the spores differ in length and morphology . it is known from korea and japan . \\n  = = habitat , distribution , and ecology = = \\n  astraeus hygrometricus is an ectomycorrhizal fungus and grows in association with a broad range of tree species . the mutualistic association between tree roots and the mycelium of the fungus helps the trees extract nutrients ( particularly phosphorus ) from the earth ; in exchange , the fungus receives carbohydrates from photosynthesis . in north america , associations with oak and pine are usual , while in india , it has been noted to grow commonly with chir pine ( pinus roxburghii ) and sal ( shorea robusta ) . the false earthstar is found on the ground in open fields , often scattered or in groups , especially in nutrient @-@ poor , sandy or loamy soils . it has also been reported to grow on rocks , preferring acid substrates like slate and granite , while avoiding substrates rich in lime . in nepal , fruit bodies have been collected at elevations of 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . fruit bodies typically appear in autumn , although the dry fruit bodies are persistent and may last up to several years . gelatinipulvinella astraeicola is a leotiaceous fungus with minute , gelatinous , pulvinate ( cushion @-@ shaped ) apothecia , known to grow only on the inner surface of the rays of dead astraeus species , including a. hygrometricus . \\n  the species has a cosmopolitan distribution except for arctic , alpine and cold temperate regions ; it is common in temperate and tropical regions of the world . it has been collected in africa , asia , australia , europe , north america , and south america . \\n  = = bioactive compounds = = \\n  mushroom polysaccharides from a number of species have attracted research interest for their immunomodulatory and antitumor properties . extracts from a. hygrometricus containing the polysaccharide named ae2 were found to inhibit the growth of several tumor cell lines in laboratory tests , and stimulated the growth of splenocytes , thymocytes , and bone marrow cells from mice . the extract also stimulated mouse cells associated with the immune system ; specifically , it enhanced the activity of mouse natural killer cells , stimulated macrophages to produce nitric oxide , and enhanced production of cytokines . the activation of macrophages by ae2 might be mediated by a mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase pathway of signal transduction . ae2 is made of the simple sugars mannose , glucose , and fucose in a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio . \\n  in addition to the previously known steroid compounds ergosta @-@ 7 @,@ 22 @-@ diene @-@ 3 @-@ ol acetate and ergosta @-@ 4,6,8- ( 14 ) , 22 @-@ tetraene @-@ 3 @-@ one , three unique

compound has a polyhydroxylated ergostane @-@ type nucleus . \\n  ethanol extracts of the fruit body are high in antioxidant activity , and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti @-@ inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac . studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective ( liver @-@ protecting ) ability , possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver @-@ damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride . \\n  = = traditional beliefs = = \\n  this earthstar has been used in traditional chinese medicine as a hemostatic agent ; the spore dust is applied externally to stop wound bleeding and reduce chilblains . two indian forest tribes , the baiga

= \\n  the fox , the wolf and the husbandman is a poem by the 15th @-@ century scottish poet robert henryson and part of his collection of moral fables known as the morall fabillis of esope the phrygian . it is written in middle scots . as with the other tales in the collection , appended to it is a moralitas which elaborates on the moral that the fable is supposed to contain . however , the appropriateness of the moralitas for the tale itself has been questioned . \\n  the tale combines two motifs . firstly , a husbandman tilling the fields with his new oxen makes a rash oath aloud to give them to the wolf ; when the wolf overhears this , he attempts to make sure that the man fulfills his promise . the fox mediates a solution by speaking to them individually ; eventually he fools the wolf into following him to claim his supposed reward for dropping the case , and tricks him into a draw @-@ well . the moralitas connects the wolf to the wicked man , the fox to the devil , and the husbandman to the godly man . a probable source for the tale is petrus alfonsi \\'s disciplina clericalis , containing the same motifs , and william caxton \\'s aesop \\'s fables — though the tale is a beast fable , not aesopic . \\n  = = source = = \\n  a probable source of the tale is petrus alfonsi \\'s disciplina clericalis , which has the same three motifs : the rash promise of the husbandman ; the wolf mistaking the moon for cheese ; and the wolf that descends into the well via a bucket , thereby trapping himself and freeing the fox . however , the discussion of legality and the questioning of language that take place alongside these motifs are entirely henryson \\'s invention . whereas the moral of alfonsi \\'s tale explains that the wolf lost both the oxen and the cheese because he \" relinquished what was present for what was to come \" ( latin : pro futuro quod presens erat dimisit ) , henryson \\'s moralitas more fully involves the husbandman . \\n  another source may be aesop \\'s fables as published by william caxton — scholar john macqueen considers this more likely than disciplina clericalis — although the tale itself is not aesopic but rather of the beast fable ( also beast @-@ epic ) genre . the plots of such works are more complicated than their aesopic counterpart , tend more towards ribaldry , and feature the fox making a victim of the wolf .

the wolf \" mot have you all at anis ! [ may , at once ] \" . however , the wolf is lying nearby with the fox , and , overhearing it , promises to make him stay true to his word . eventually the oxen calm down , but on the way back home the wolf jumps into their path . the wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them , since they are not his , to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before . the wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration , to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything . they argue , and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness ; in response , he produces the fox . the creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute , and takes each aside in turn . to the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him were it not for the \" grit coist and expence \" of doing so ; the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has , to which the fox acedes and goes off . to the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case . \\n  the wolf , after some complaint , agrees to this and the two proceed through the woods after the prize — all the while the fox considers how to trick the wolf . eventually , as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest , they arrive at a draw @-@ well with buckets on each end of a rope . seeing the reflection of the moon in the water at the bottom of the well , the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up . when he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone , the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help . however , this pulls up the other bucket , into which the fox has jumped , and so the two swap places ; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped . the narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well , but that the tale is at an end . \\n  = = = moralitas = = = \\n  the wolf is likened to a wicked man who oppresses others . the fox is likened to the devil . the farmer is likened to the godly man , with whom the fiend finds fault . the woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get . the cheese represents covetousness ; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy , which draws men downwards into hell . \\n  = = analysis = = \\n  as with other tales in the collection , the moralitas of the fox , the wolf and the husbandman can be considered at odds with the tale itself . lianne farber highlights a number of these discrepancies , and says that the allegory \" does not hold true in any traditional sense \" . amongst the inconsistencies is that the fox , not the wolf , is the figure that argues with and finds fault in the husbandman ; the \" woods of the world \" are not traversed by the husbandman , in spite of the moralitas suggesting it is applicable to all men ; farber argues that even assuming the moral to be true is problematic , since it apparently suggests that the godly man must bribe the figure of the judge , and that this does not affect his godly status . furthermore , the absence of the legal discussion and the binding quality of words from the moralitas suggests to farber that the \" intricate legal framework … has no impact whatsoever in resolving the issues with which it is supposed to deal \" . in contrast , philippa m. bright considers that the moralitas of this tale , as well as several others , create \" an additional sense which co @-@ exists with the literal narrative and extends and complements it thematically \" ; treating literal details symbolically and establishing the sense through direct comparisons . \\n  according to dorothy yamamoto , the significant themes in the tale are \" solidity and vacancy , substance and illusion \" . the cheese that apparently resides in the well is only an illusion , not a solid object , and similarly the fox creates a surface reconciliation between the wolf and the husbandman , but which betrays his real intentions . through their frequent misuse , words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning . as an example , yamamoto highlights the fox \\'s taill on which the wolf and husbandman make their pledge — which body part she says is used by the fox in other tales to blind his foes , and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use . \\n  = = = modern edition = = = \\n  henryson , robert ( 2009 ) . the testament of cresseid & seven fables . trans. by

championship teams twice in a playing career that lasted thirteen seasons ; in january 1907 with the kenora thistles and 1908 with the montreal wanderers . like other players of the time , ross played for several different teams and leagues , and is most notable for his time with the wanderers while they were members of the national hockey association ( nha ) and its successor , the national hockey league ( nhl ) . in 1911 he led one of the first organized player strikes over increased pay . when the wanderers \\' home arena burned down in january 1918 , the team ceased operations and ross

, ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches . for the 1909 season ross demanded a salary of $ 1 @,@ 600 . although he settled for $ 1 @,@ 200 , the average salary of hockey players at the time was $ 600 . ross received a cash bonus of $ 400 to play in a stanley cup challenge against a team from edmonton in december 1908 , in which the wanderers won the two @-@ game , total @-@ goal series 13 – 10 . he finished the season with two goals in nine games . \\n  = = = 1909 – 18 = = = \\n  a new league , the canadian hockey association ( cha ) , was formed in late november 1909 . one of the teams , the all @-@ montreal hockey club , hired ross as a playing @-@ manager , but the league only lasted to mid @-@ january 1910 before disbanding . ross , who scored four goals in four games in the cha , then signed with the haileybury comets of the national hockey association ( nha ) , a league formed in december 1909 , which proved to be the stronger replacement to the ecaha as the highest level of hockey in canada . he received $ 2 @,@ 700 to play in the 1910 season , which lasted from january to march , playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals . before the following season , the nha imposed a salary cap of $ 5 @,@ 000 per team . the players , including ross , were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease , and began looking to form their own league without a cap . ross wrote to the montreal herald , stating \" all the players want is a fair deal ... the players are not trying to bulldoze the nha , but we want to know where we get off at . \" the plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the nha . ross scored four goals in eleven games with the wanderers , who finished fourth in the five team league . during a match against the quebec bulldogs on february 25 , 1911 , ross knocked out eddie oatman in a fight , provoking a massive brawl between the two teams , which the police had to break up . the fight helped to increase the reputation ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent . the following season ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the wanderers improved to second in the league . \\n  prior to the 1913 – 14 nha season , ross refused to sign a contract for the wanderers , requesting a salary increase . as one of the top players on the team , the wanderers agreed to his demands of $ 1 @,@ 500 for the forthcoming season , in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games . the next season ross , again concerned with his salary , began negotiating with other players in the nha to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages . these actions resulted in his suspension in november 1914 by emmett quinn , president of the nha . ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the wanderers was no longer valid . consequently , although having no technical power to do so , quinn suspended ross from all organized hockey . the proposed new league failed to materialize and ross applied for reinstatement to the nha , which was granted at a meeting of the team owners on december 18 , 1914 . the owners realized if they suspended ross , they would also have to suspend all those he signed , hurting the league . however , ross \\'s actions led to his release by the wanderers . at first he trained with the montreal canadiens , then joined the ottawa senators . \\n  at the conclusion of the 1914 – 15 season , the senators and wanderers finished with identical records of fourteen wins and six losses . a two @-@ game , total goal series was played to determine the nha league champion who would contest the stanley cup with the pacific coast hockey association winner , the vancouver millionaires . ross , who finished with three goals in sixteen games in the season , scored one goal in the first match against the wanderers , a senators 4 – 0 victory , and though ottawa lost the second game 1 – 0 , they won the series , 4 – 1 . to help the senators stop the wanderers , who were known for their speed , ross created a new system of defence . termed \" kitty bar the door \" , it required three defenders to align themselves across the ice 30 feet in front of the goaltender to stop offensive rushes . this style of defence would later be used in a modified version known as the neutral zone trap , later used widely to stop opposition offensive chances . \\n  the following year ross , who had eight goals and eight assists in twenty @-@ one games , was the second highest paid player on the team ; his salary of $ 1 @,@ 400 was $ 100 less than frank nighbor made . even so , ross left the team in 1916 , returning to montreal in order to look after his sporting @-@ goods store , and rejoining the wanderers . he scored six goals and had two assists in sixteen games for the team . the wanderers , along with the montreal canadiens , toronto arenas , quebec bulldogs and ottawa senators dissolved the nha and founded the national hockey league ( nhl ) in november 1917 . ross became coach of the wanderers , but a fire on january 2 , 1918 , destroyed their home , the montreal arena , and forced them to fold after four games . however , the nhl insisted the team continue to play , and recorded two additional scheduled matches as defaulted losses for the wanderers , even though the matches were not played . with the wanderers disbanded , ross retired as a player . his nhl career yielded one goal in three games played . \\n  = = managerial career = = \\n  = = = 1918 – 36 = = = \\n  ross began his career as a hockey coach in the midst of his playing days , when at age 24 he led the mcgill university redmen to a 4 – 2 – 1 record during the 1910 – 11 season . following his playing career , ross became a nhl referee . he was hired to coach the hamilton tigers for the 1922 – 23 season , and adopted new methods in training camp that emphasized physical fitness , including work off the ice . however , the tigers finished with a record of six wins and eighteen losses , last in the nhl for the third successive year , and ross did not return the next season . his next coaching appointment arose from meeting boston grocery store magnate charles adams during the 1924 stanley cup finals . before the 1924 season , the nhl awarded adams an expansion team . adams \\' first move was to hire ross as vice president , general manager , coach and scout . adams instructed ross to come up with a nickname portraying an untamed animal displaying speed , agility and cunning . with this in mind , ross named the team the boston bruins , after the old english word for a bear . the team \\'s nickname went perfectly with the original colours of brown and yellow , which were the same colours of adams \\' grocery chain , first national stores . \\n  ross utilized his many hockey connections throughout canada and the united states to sign players . even so , the team started poorly . early in the first season the university of toronto hockey team was in boston for matches against local universities . the team \\'s manager , conn smythe , who later owned and managed the toronto maple leafs , said that his team could easily defeat the bruins — ross \\'s team had won only two of their first fifteen nhl games . this began a feud between smythe and ross which lasted for over 40 years , until ross \\' death ; while mostly confined to newspaper reports , they refused to speak to each other at nhl board of governor meetings . the bruins finished their first season with six wins in thirty games , one of the worst records in the history of the league . several records were set over the course of the season ; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever , and an eleven @-@ game losing streak from december 8 , 1924 , until february 17 , 1925 , set a record for longest losing streak , surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history . with 17 wins in 36 games the following season , the team greatly improved , and finished one point out of a playoff spot . \\n  in 1926 the western hockey league , the other top professional hockey league , was in decline . the patrick brothers , who controlled the league , offered to sell the remaining five teams for $ 300 @,@ 000 . ross realized the potential talent available and convinced adams to pay the money . as a result , the bruins acquired the rights to several future hall of fame players , the most notable being defender eddie shore . ross signed goaltender cecil \" tiny \" thompson in 1928 , who was with a team in minnesota , despite never watching him play ; ralph \" cooney \" weiland was also brought over from minnesota . ross acquired cy denneny from ottawa and made him a player @-@ assistant @-@ coach while he assumed the role of coach and team manager . on november 20 , 1928 , the bruins moved to a new arena when the boston garden opened . the team played the canadiens who won the match 1 – 0 in front of 16 @,@ 000 fans . the players signed by ross helped the bruins to improve quickly , and they won the stanley cup in 1929 . denneny retired after the cup win , ross guiding the team to several league records in the 1929 – 30 season . the team won 38 of 44 games for an .875 winning percentage , the highest in league history ; the five losses tied a record for fewest ever , and the four road losses tied a record for second fewest . the bruins also only finished one game in a tie , a record for fewest ties in a season since the nhl began recording the record in 1926 . one of the longest winning streaks was also set during the season . from december 3 , 1929 , until january 9 , 1930 , the team won fourteen games in a row , a record that lasted until 1982 and now tied for third longest , as of october 2010 . a home winning streak began the same day and lasted for twenty games , until march 18 , 1930 , which was tied for the longest of its kind in 1976 . in 1930 – 31 , the bruins again lost only one home game , which equalled their previous record . \\n  on march 26 , 1931 , ross substituted a sixth skater for goaltender tiny thompson in the final minute of play in a playoff game against the montreal canadiens . although the bruins lost the game 1 – 0 , ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an extra attacker , a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey . stepping aside as coach in 1934 to focus on managing the team , ross hired frank patrick as coach with a salary of $ 10 @,@ 500 , which was high for such a role . however rumours spread during the season that patrick was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as ross wanted . after the bruins lost their playoff series with the toronto maple leafs in the 1936 playoffs , the result of an 8 – 1 score in the second game , a newspaper claimed that patrick had been drinking the day of the game and had trouble controlling the team . several days later , ross relieved patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach . \\n  = = = 1936 – 54 = = = \\n  ross took over an improved team . he had recently signed three players , milt schmidt , bobby bauer and woody dumart , who all grew up together in kitchener , ontario , and had them play on the same line , soon nicknamed the kraut line in reference to the german heritage of all three . along with them , ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938 , frank brimsek ; after brimsek earned six shutouts in his first eight games , the bruins traded away tiny thompson to allow brimsek to play . with these players the bruins finished first in the league in 1937 – 38 ; ross was named as the second best coach in the league , selected for the end of season all @-@ star second team . the next season the bruins won 36 of 48 games , and won the stanley cup in the playoffs ; ross was named to the first all @-@ star team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games , which is tied for the second fewest in a season . he hired the recently retired cooney weiland to coach the bruins for the 1939 – 40 nhl season . the bruins would win the cup again in 1941 , and tied their record of only four away losses all season . ross once again took over as coach of the team before the 1941 – 42 season began , as weiland became coach of the hershey bears of the american hockey league , and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games , which was enough to earn third place in the league . by this time the second world war had caused several bruins players , including the entire kraut line and goaltender brimsek , to enlist in their respective armed forces . the bruins finished second in the nhl during the 1942 – 43 season with 24 wins in 50 games and ross was again named in the second nhl all @-@ star team as second best coach in the league . the bruins missed the playoffs in 1943 – 44 , the first time in ten years they failed to qualify , but returned to the playoffs the next season , something they did for five straight years . \\n  in 1949 , ross had signed georges boucher as coach , but boucher did not work well with ross and team president weston adams . looking to hire a new coach in the summer of 1950 , ross phoned lynn patrick , the son of lester , who had just resigned from the new york rangers after coaching the team to the stanley cup final . lynn had moved his family back to victoria , british columbia , where he grew up as a child , with the intention of coaching the victoria cougars , a team in the minor professional pacific coast hockey league . though reluctant to move back to the eastern united states , lynn was hired by ross after he was offered a salary of $ 12 @,@ 000 . he would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the bruins when ross retired at the end of october 1954 . \\n  = = = legacy = = = \\n  aside from his career in hockey , ross was interested in improving the game . prior to the start of the 1927 – 28 season , the nhl adopted a new style of goal net created by ross . with the back molded into a b @-@ shape , it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984 , when a modified version was adopted . he also improved the design of the puck . ross \\' design had bevel edges , which prevented it bouncing too much , and used synthetic rubber , rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue . along with new york rangers coach frank boucher , ross helped to create the red line , which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone ; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass . more scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity . in order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television , ross suggested that the red line be striped . \\n  regarded throughout his playing career as one of the best defenders in hockey , ross was named to the hockey hall of fame in 1949 , selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive . a ceremony for his induction was held prior to a bruins game on december 2 , 1949 , where he was given his hall of fame scroll and a silver tray with the emblems of the six nhl teams on it . in 1975 he was inducted into the canadian sports hall of fame . along with his two sons he donated the art ross trophy to the nhl in 1947 , to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league \\'s regular season . in 1984 he was posthumously awarded the lester patrick trophy for service to hockey in the united states . \\n  a descriptive biography entitled art ross : the hockey legend who built the bruins by eric zweig was published by dundurn press in sept 2015 . \\n  = = personal life = = \\n  ross also excelled in baseball , football , lacrosse and motorcycle racing . before he became a hockey executive , he had a career as a bank clerk and ran a sporting @-@ goods store in montreal . ross had moved to brandon , manitoba , in 1905 at the advice of his parents so he could get a job with a bank , with a salary of $ 600 per year . he gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally . he was married to muriel , a native of montreal , and had two sons , art and john . during the second world war , both sons served in the royal canadian air force . after the war ross made his son art the business manager for the bruins . ross was named coach and manager of the boston bruins in 1924 and moved his family to brookline , massachusetts , a suburb of boston , after being hired . in 1928 , he served as the traveling secretary of the boston braves baseball team , which was owned by bruins owner charles adams . he became a naturalized american citizen on april 22 , 1938 . on august 5 , 1964 , ross died at a nursing home in medford , massachusetts , a suburb of boston , at the age of 79 . a

officially platted by barnes in 1870 or 1871 . in 1875 , it became the county seat of madison county , and in 1876 it was incorporated . the union pacific railroad reached madison in 1879 ; by 1880 , the town had a population of about 300 . \\n  the first christian services held in madison were presbyterian , taking place in barnes \\'s and other homes . a presbyterian congregation was organized

a lutheran congregation may have formed in madison in about 1875 , although early records are incomplete ; the congregation was initially served by the pastor of a lutheran church in green garden precinct , located about seven miles ( 11 km ) southwest of madison . it was formally organized in 1885 , and a church built in madison in 1887 . \\n  the first catholic settlers in madison county homesteaded near present @-@ day battle creek , northwest of madison , in the late 1860s . in 1874 , they organized a parish ; in 1874 – 75 , they built st. patrick \\'s church , the county \\'s first catholic church . in 1877 , they wrote to bishop james o \\'connor of the diocese of omaha , asking that a priest be assigned to visit the church at intervals until a permanent priest could be assigned to the parish ; in apparent response to this , franciscan missionaries based in columbus were given the responsibility of providing for madison county . \\n  = = = 1879 – 1900 = = = \\n  in 1879 , a group of catholic residents of the madison area met to plan the building of a church . at the meeting , a total of $ 426 @.@ 75 was subscribed ; additional contributions of $ 322 @.@ 86 were obtained from citizens of madison . in january 1880 , the church \\'s trustees spent $ 100 for five acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) on a hill at the southeastern edge of town . in the spring , a party of

purchased for a cemetery ; a one @-@ year @-@ old child buried in september of that year became its first occupant . the cemetery was fenced in 1883 . in 1884 , the church was enlarged : a sacristy and a room for the priest were added to the east end , and a steeple to the west end . \\n  as madison \\'s population grew , the church became too small for the expanding congregation . in addition , its location outside of the city was inconvenient for many parishioners . in 1898 , a tract of land inside madison was bought . rather than building a new church at the time , the parish elected to move the old one to the new site . the church was moved in two parts ; when it was reconstructed , another section was added between them , increasing the building \\'s seating capacity to 180 . the church on the new site was dedicated in november 1898 . \\n  = = = 1900 – 1913 = = = \\n  in the early 20th century , the parish decided that the old church should be remodelled into a school and a

construction . instead , a temporary basement church was built just west of the old church building . it is not known whether the design of the basement used darscheid \\'s plans . construction of the basement church began in july 1902 , services were held there beginning in september 1902 , and it was dedicated in february 1903 . \\n  the school opened in september 1903 , with two classrooms staffed by two members of the sisters of the presentation of dubuque , iowa . 66 students were enrolled , including a number of non @-@ catholics , owing to overcrowding in the public schools . to

economic boom during the 1920s , the agricultural sector of the country experienced a depression . disruption of european agriculture by world war i had produced high prices for farm commodities , and it had been thought that europe \\'s recovery would be slow and that the high prices would persist . this gave rise to a bubble in farmland prices , which burst when the rapid postwar recovery of european agriculture drove commodity prices down again . at the same time , increasing mechanization reduced the need for farm labor , pushing agricultural wages downward and rural unemployment upward . madison and st. leonard \\'s parish suffered from this agricultural depression and from the great depression of the 1930s . during this time , the parish \\'s population remained more or less stable : in 1918 , it consisted of 440 individuals ; in 1929 , 452 . \\n  in 1926 , the parish was forced to close its school , since the presentation sisters were no longer able to staff it . the school re

caused roman to go blind , he took his anger out on nicole and aden . subsequently they became \" each other \\'s support network \" and lasance said it was not long afterward that they \" slipped between the sheets \" . one of the conditions of aden \\'s tenancy was to never sleep with nicole , this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived roman . lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with belle taylor ( jessica tovey ) - which meant he knew it would \" cause a stir \" and divide the audience . in january 2010 , nicole and aden \" get up close and personal \" and they decided to spend aden \\'s remaining time in the bay together . they shared a kiss and james told tv week that there are \" a lot of complications \"

weaving ) at a \" rowdy \" venue . james explained that nicole saw alcohol as an answer to her problems . the fact that \" she \\'s trying to deal with too many things \" saw nicole transform into a messed up and depressed person . \\n  nicole became more irresponsible with the more she drank and was in the company of many men . geoff arrived and saved her from danger , lewis said there was a part of geoff that still loved nicole . however they did not start anything again , james said she understood why because of their complicated backstory . however geoff continued to support nicole as

her mothering instinct after giving george away . nicole came to visit the baby and marilyn caught her breastfeeding george , while she was alone with him . symons called the scenes \" volatile . \" nicole was unaware that marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby . of the breastfeeding scene , symons stated : \" marilyn is shocked and offended , and this cuts to the very

the mexican state of chiapas , some 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) east of the town of ocosingo . \\n  the site is medium to large , with groups of temple @-@ pyramids set on terraces rising some 71 metres ( 233 ft ) above a plaza , a large court for playing the mesoamerican ballgame , and over 100 carved monuments , most dating from the 6th century through the 9th centuries ad , during the classic period . toniná is distinguished by its well preserved stucco sculptures and particularly by its in @-@ the @-@ round carved monuments , produced to an extent not seen in mesoamerica since the end of the much earlier olmec civilization . \\n  toniná was an aggressive state in the late classic , using warfare to develop a powerful kingdom . for much of its history , toniná was engaged in sporadic warfare with palenque , its greatest rival and one of the most important polities in the west of the maya region , although toniná eventually became the dominant city in the west . \\n  the city is notable for having the last known long count date on any maya monument , marking the end of the classic maya period in ad 909 . \\n  = = etymology = = \\n  toniná means house of stone in the tzeltal language of the local maya inhabitants , an alternate interpretation is the place where stone sculptures are raised to honour time . however , this is a modern name and the original name was either po or popo , appearing in classic maya texts in the title used for the kings of toniná , k \\'uhul po \\' ajaw ( divine lord of po ) . a maya rebellion in colonial times , in 1558 , featured a group called the po \\' winikob \\' ( people of po ) . early versions of the toniná emblem glyph bore a doubled po glyph and the term popo is also found in colonial records . since double sounds were often abbreviated in hieroglyphic texts , popo may represent the original name of the city . \\n  = = location = = \\n  toniná is located at an altitude of 800 to 900 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 to 3 @,@ 000 ft ) above mean sea level in the chiapas highlands of southern mexico , some 40 miles ( 64 km ) south of the contemporary maya city of palenque , toniná \\'s greatest rival throughout its recorded history . toniná is separated from palenque by mountainous terrain and the site core is located along an easily defended ascending limestone ridge immediately to the west of a seasonal tributary of the río jataté , one of the two rivers forming the ocosingo valley . \\n  = = rulers = = \\n  rulers of toniná recorded in the maya script on toniná monuments include : \\n  the last known recorded date at

classic remains lie entirely buried under later construction . due to this , early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of the early history of the site . an 8th @-@ century text refers to a king ruling in ad 217 , although it only mentions his title , not his name . \\n  ruler 1 is depicted on a couple of early classic monuments , the better preserved of which is an altar that dates to 514 . a ruler known as jaguar bird peccary is represented on a 6th @-@ century stela , which describes him acceding to the throne in 568 . \\n  the first mention of toniná in a record from a foreign state is from the site of chinikiha , located 72 kilometres ( 45 mi ) to the northeast on the usumacinta river , the text is from a throne and describes the capture of a person from toniná in 573 . \\n  = =

hix chapat is in a monument dated to 665 that appears to be a memorial stone . \\n  = = = = ruler 2 = = = = \\n  ruler 2 acceded to the throne of toniná in 668 . his rule is marked by warfare and the frequent depiction of bound captives on his monuments . ruler 2 established the use of in @-@ the @-@ round sculptural style that came to typify the stelae of toniná . a monument dated to 682 depicts three naked prisoners with their arms bound , one of them is identified as a lord from annak \\' , an as yet unidentified site . his reign may have ended with his defeat and capture by k \\'inich kan balam ii of palenque in september 687 , as described in a glyphic text from temple 17 in the rival city , an event that probably culminated in his sacrifice . \\n  = = = = k \\'inich b \\'aaknal chaak = = = = \\n  k \\'inich b \\'aaknal chaak was enthroned in 688 , twenty years after ruler 2 , and reigned for twenty @-@ seven years . during his reign he restored toniná \\'s power with a number of military victories over palenque , and his reign was dominated by the struggle against the rival city for regional power . ballcourt 1 , the larger of toniná \\'s two ballcourts , was dedicated in 699 to celebrate three victories over the city \\'s arch @-@ rival . the ballcourt originally had six sculptures of bound captives , all vassals of the enemy palenque king from the usumacinta region . the date of the king \\'s death is unknown . \\n  = = = = ruler 4 = = = = \\n  ruler 4 came to power in 708 at a very young age . three years later , in 711 , while ruler 4 was still a child , toniná gained an important victory over palenque . the battle resulted in the capture of kan joy chitam ii of palenque and made toniná the dominant centre in the lower usumacinta region . the victory was so complete that it resulted in a ten @-@ year gap in the dynastic history of the defeated city , during which the captured ruler may have been held hostage . ruler 4 continued in power to celebrate the period endings of 716 and 721 . a captive depicted on one of his monuments is identified as being from the distant city of calakmul , one of the two maya \" superpowers \" . \\n  = = = = k \\'inich ich \\'aak chapat = = = = \\n  ruler 4 was succeeded by k \\'inich ich \\'aak chapat in 723 . around 725 toniná fought a war against piedras negras , a city on the north bank of the usumacinta river , now in guatemala . a series of events during his reign were marked on monuments between 726 and 729 and in 730 he rededicated the tomb of his predecessor k \\'inich b \\'aaknal chaak . the mother of k \\'inich ich \\'aak chapat is named as lady winik timan k \\'awiil and his father may well have been k \\'inich b \\'aaknal chaak himself . the reign of k \\'inich ich \\'aak chapat is notable for the absence of the usual sculptures depicting bound war captives , although the reason for this is unknown . \\n  = = = = later rulers = = = = \\n  little is known of the next two rulers , ruler 6 is named as k \\'inich tuun chapat , he celebrated the period ending of 736 and may have died 762 . a damaged text accompanying the image of a bound captive indicates renewed warfare with palenque during his reign , however the name of the prisoner is lost and it is unclear if it is the actual king of palenque or merely one of his vassals . he was succeeded by ruler 7 , about whom even less is known . around 764 toniná defeated palenque in battle . \\n  in 775 a text recorded the death of lord wak chan k \\'ak \\' , a prince who appears to have been the heir to the throne and who died before he could take power . \\n  ruler 8 was the last of the successful warrior kings of toniná . he celebrated a series of events between 789 and 806 , including the defeat of pomoy in 789 , and the capture of the ruler ucha \\'an aj chih , who appears to have been the vassal of b \\'olon k \\'awiil of calakmul . in 799 he rededicated the tomb of ruler 1 . ruler 8 oversaw an extensive remodelling of the upper levels of the acropolis . ruler 8 erected a number of sculptures of bound prisoners of war and adopted the title aj b \\'olon b \\'aak , \" he of many captives \" . however , the lesser extent of toniná \\'s power is evident from its victory over the site of sak tz \\'i \\' ( white dog ) , an important city in the lacandon region , an area which had once been dominated by toniná . \\n  by the time of ruler 8 \\'s successor , uh chapat , toniná was clearly in decline . only a single event , in 837 , can be dated to his reign , although a stucco mural depicting captives with garrottes at their throats may belong to his period of rule . \\n  the history of toniná continued after most other classic maya cities had fallen , perhaps aided by the site \\'s relative isolation . ruler 10 is associated with a monument dating to 904 in the terminal classic and a monument dating to 909 bears the last known long count date although the name of the king has not survived . ceramic fragments indicate that occupation at the site continued for another century or more . \\n  = = = modern history = = = \\n  the first published account of the ruins was made by fray jacinto garrido at the end of the 17th century . a number of visitors investigated the ruins of toniná in the 19th century , the first being an expedition led by guillaume dupaix in 1808 . john lloyd stephens and frederick catherwood visited in 1840 , and stephens wrote an extensive description of the site . eduard seler and caecilie seler @-@ sachs investigated the monuments at toniná , publishing their reports at the turn of the 20th century . karl sapper visited the site in 1895 and 1896 . frans blom and oliver la farge investigated the site in 1920s for tulane university , publishing their reports in 1926 — 1927 . \\n  the french toniná project began excavations in 1972 which continued through 1975 , then resumed in 1979 to 1980 , under the direction of pierre becquelin and claude baudez . the national institute of anthropology and history of mexico ( inah , the instituto nacional de antropologia e historia ) began their own excavations at toniná the following year . \\n  the site is accessible for tourism and has a small museum that was inaugurated on 15 july 2000 . \\n  = = site description = = \\n  the site was built on a platform covering 6 hectares ( 650 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . the principal architecture is located in the acropolis , which occupies seven south @-@ facing terraces on the northern side of the platform , rising 71 metres ( 233 ft ) over the plaza below . it has a more distinct geometry than at most maya sites , with a right @-@ angle relationship between most structures . \\n  much of the public imagery of the site details the ruthless manner in which the city dealt with its enemies . a 16 by 4 metres ( 52 by 13 ft ) stucco sculpture rising from the fourth to fifth terraces depicts a skeletal death god carrying the severed head of a lord of palenque in one hand . a frieze on the fifth terrace probably displayed toniná \\'s most distinguished victims , dozens of fragments of this frieze were discovered in the plaza below . this frieze was carved from the local sandstone but its style is that of palenque , suggesting that captured artists carried out the work . \\n  after the abandonment of the city at the end of the classic period , many of the sculptures fell down the steep embankment supporting the seven terraces . \\n  = = = structures = = = \\n  ballcourt 1 ( the sunken ballcourt ) was dedicated in 699 by k \\'inich b \\'aaknal chaak to mark three victories over k \\'inich kan balam ii of palenque . sculptures of the torsos of six captured vassals of the palenque king were used as ballcourt markers . one of these vassals is named as yax ahk ( green turtle ) , who was the lord of annay te \\' , a site that probably lay on the south side of the usumacinta between piedras negras and yaxchilán . \\n  ballcourt 2 is the smaller of the two ballcourts and lies in the north of the plaza , at the foot of the acropolis . \\n  the palace of the underworld is entered via three step @-@ vaulted arches on the eastern side of the second terrace of the acropolis . \\n  the palace of frets is located on the fourth terrace of the acropolis . the south facade of the palace is decorated with four large stepped frets . on the east side of the palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco . one of the rooms of the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones . \\n  = = = monuments and sculptures = = = \\n  the monuments of toniná tend to be smaller than those at other maya sites , with most of the stelae measuring less than 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) tall . the most important difference from monuments at other maya sites is that they are carved in the round like statues , often with hieroglyphic text running down the spine . on the fifth terrace , in @-@ the @-@ round sculptures of toniná \\'s rulers dominated two @-@ dimensional representations of defeated enemies . \\n  the dated monuments at toniná span the period from ad 495 to 909 , covering most of the classic period . \\n  monument 3 is broken into various fragments , five of which were recovered from various locations in ocosingo and toniná through the course of the 20th century and most of which were reunited in the toniná site museum . aside from being broken , the stela is largely complete and only lightly eroded , it is a statue of a ruler with inscriptions describing the accession of k \\'inich baaknal chaak and the promotion to the priesthood of aj ch \\'aaj naah . \\n  monument 5 was recovered from a school in ocosingo and moved to the site museum of toniná . it is a badly eroded life @-@ size human statue with the head missing . \\n  monument 7 is carved from yellow sandstone and has suffered only minor damage . it is a stela base with well @-@ preserved hieroglyphs on all four vertical sides and was dedicated by k \\'inich ich \\'aak chapat in 728 . it is currently in the museo regional in tuxtla gutiérrez . \\n  monument 8 dates to the reign of ruler 2 . it marks the period ending of 682 and shows the presentation of three war captives . \\n  monument 12 is a sculpture carved in the round , representing ruler 2 . it dates to ad 672 . \\n  monument 27 is a carved step depicting k \\'awiil mo \\' , a lord from palenque , as an elderly prisoner , bound and lying on his back with his profile positioned in such a way as to be trodden on time and again . \\n  monument 99 is an undated fragment that depicts a female captive , which is rare in maya art . \\n  monument 101 has the last long count date from any maya monument , it marks the k \\'atun ending of ad 909 . \\n  monument 106 is the earliest securely dated monument at the site , dating to ad 593 . it depicts ruler 1 . \\n  monument 113 depicts ruler 2 participating in a scattering ritual . \\n  monument 114 was dedicated in 794 by ruler 8 . it commemorates the death of an important noble , apparently a relative or vassal of ruler 8 \\'s predecessor tuun chapat . \\n  monument 122 is a low relief sculpture marking the defeat of palenque by ruler 4 in 711 and the capture of kan joy chitam ii , who is depicted as a bound captive . \\n  monument 141 is a very well preserved hieroglyphic panel carved from fine grained white limestone with almost the whole inscription intact . it describes the dedication of a ballcourt by k \\'inich b \\'aaknal chaak . \\n  monument 154 dates to the reign of k \\'inich hix chapat and records his installing of two subordinate lords in 633 . \\n  monument 158 has a very late date , in ad 904 , at the very end of the classic period . it was erected during the reign of ruler 10 . \\n  the frieze of the dream lords ( also known as the frieze of the four suns or frieze of the four eras ) was uncovered by archaeologists during excavations in 1992 . it is a stucco mural located at the east end of the 5th terrace . it represents a complex supernatural scene divided into four by a feather @-@ covered scaffold from which hang the severed heads of sacrificial victims . among the scaffold partitions are depicted the wayob ( spirit companions ) of the maya elite . the most well @-@ preserved section of the sculpture depicts a skeletal supernatural way named ak ok kimi ( \" turtle foot death \" ) wearing turtleshells on its feet and carrying a severed head in one hand , interpreted as the way of a lord from the site of pipa \\' . the frieze was once brightly painted in red , blue and yellow . this frieze has strong stylistic parallels with mural paintings at the great early classic metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant valley of mexico . \\n  = = = the site museum = = = \\n  the site museum is located 300 metres ( 980 ft ) outside of the toniná archaeological zone . it possesses 2 exhibition rooms and a conference room . the first room explains the pyramidal form of the acropolis and how it relates to maya mythology , while the main room contains sculptures of the city \\'s rulers . \\n  artefacts in the collection include stone sculptures , ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone , shell , obsidian and flint . the pieces in the museum graphically depict the two sides of the power exercised by toniná , on the one hand with sculptures of the city \\'s rulers and on the other with its depictions of bound prisoners of war . \\n  = central area command ( raaf ) = \\n  central area command was one of several geographically based commands raised by the royal australian air force ( raaf ) during world war ii . it was formed in march 1940 , and covered the central portion of new south wales . headquartered at sydney , central area command was primarily responsible for air defence , aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries . it was disbanded in august 1941 and control of its units taken over by other raaf formations . proposals in 1943 – 44 to raise a new central area command did not come to fruition . \\n  = = history = = \\n  prior to world war ii , the royal australian air force was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by raaf headquarters in melbourne . after war broke out in september 1939 , the raaf began to implement a decentralised form of command , commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units . its initial move in this direction was to create nos. 1 and 2 groups to control units in victoria and new south wales , respectively . then , between march 1940 and may 1941 , the raaf divided australia and new guinea into four geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control zones : central area , southern area , western area , and northern area . the roles of these area commands were air defence , protection of adjacent sea lanes , and aerial reconnaissance . each was led by an air officer commanding ( aoc ) responsible for the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary . \\n  no. 2 group , which had been established on 20 november 1939 , was re @-@ formed as one of the first two area commands , central area , on 7 march 1940 . headquartered in sydney , central area command was given control of all air force units in new south wales except those in the southern riverina and the north of the state . units in queensland were also temporarily assigned to its control , pending the formation of northern area . central area \\'s inaugural aoc was air commodore adrian \" king \" cole , who had also led no. 2 group . his senior air staff officer was wing commander alan charlesworth . \\n  in may 1940 it was reported that the area \\'s headquarters building would change from \" mont loana \" in point piper to the mansion \" kilmory \" nearby . cole handed over command of central area to air commodore bill anderson in december 1940 . by august 1941 , the raaf \\'s expanding instructional program necessitated the establishment of overarching training organisations on a semi @-@ functional , semi @-@ geographical basis . accordingly , no. 2 ( training ) group was formed in sydney , taking responsibility for the training units then under central area , which was disbanded . control of other central area units was \" divided as convenient \" , according to the official history of the war , between northern and southern area commands . \\n  = = aftermath = = \\n  the raaf \\'s area command structure was revised in 1942 , following the outbreak of the pacific war : northern area was split into north @-@ eastern area and north @-@ western area , and a new command covering new south wales and southern queensland , eastern area , was created , making a total of five commands . in october 1943 , the air board proposed carving a new central area command out of eastern area , which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision . this central area command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern queensland . the war cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal . the concept was raised again in august 1944 , and this time the new central area command was to control maintenance units , as well as training and operations , in southern queensland . once again , nothing came of the proposal . \\n  = corn crake = \\n  the corn crake , corncrake or landrail ( crex crex ) is a bird in the rail family . it breeds in europe and asia as far east as western china , and migrates to africa for the northern hemisphere \\'s winter . it is a medium @-@ sized crake with buff- or grey @-@ streaked brownish @-@ black upperparts , chestnut markings on the wings , and blue @-@ grey underparts with rust @-@ coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail . the strong bill is flesh @-@ toned , the iris is pale brown , and the legs and feet are pale grey . juveniles are similar in plumage to adults , and downy chicks are black , as with all rails . there are no subspecies , although individuals from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts . the male \\'s call is a loud krek krek , from which the scientific name is derived . the corn crake is larger than its closest relative , the african crake , which shares its wintering range ; that species is also darker @-@ plumaged , and has a plainer face . \\n  the corn crake \\'s breeding habitat is grassland , particularly hayfields , and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds . this secretive species builds a nest of grass leaves in a hollow in the ground and lays 6 – 14 cream @-@ coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches . these hatch in 19 – 20 days , and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks . this crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed . the corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates , the occasional small frog or mammal , and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain . natural threats include introduced and feral mammals , large birds , various parasites and diseases . \\n  although numbers have declined steeply in western europe , this bird is classed as least concern on the iucn red list because of its huge range and large , apparently stable , populations in russia and kazakhstan . numbers in western china are more significant than previously thought , and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses . despite its elusive nature , the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature , and garnered a range of local and dialect names . \\n  = = taxonomy = = \\n  the rails are a bird family comprising nearly 150 species . although origins of the group are lost in antiquity , the largest number of species and least specialised forms are found in the old world , suggesting this family originated there . the taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated , but the closest relative of the corn crake is the african crake , c. egregia , which has sometimes been given its own genus , crecopsis , but is now more usually placed in crex . both species are short @-@ billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails . porzana crakes , particularly the ash @-@ throated crake ( porzana albicollis ) are near relatives of the crex genus . \\n  corn crakes were first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as rallus crex , but was subsequently moved to the genus crex , created by german naturalist and ornithologist johann matthäus bechstein in 1803 , and named crex pratensis . the earlier use of crex gives it priority over bechstein \\'s specific name pratensis , and leads to the current name of crex crex . the binomial name , crex crex , from the ancient greek \" κρεξ \" , is onomatopoeic , referring to the crake \\'s repetitive grating call . the common name was formerly spelt as a single word , \" corncrake \" , but the official version is now \" corn crake \" . the english names refer to the species habit of nesting in dry hay or cereal fields , rather than marshes used by most members of this family . \\n  = = description = = \\n  the corn crake is a medium @-@ sized rail , 27 – 30 cm ( 11 – 12 in ) long with a wingspan of 42 – 53 cm ( 17 – 21 in ) . males weigh 165 g ( 5 @.@ 8 oz ) on average and females 145 g ( 5 @.@ 1 oz ) . the adult male has the crown of its head and all of its upperparts brown @-@ black in colour , streaked with buff or grey . the wing coverts are a distinctive chestnut colour with some white bars . the face , neck and breast are blue @-@ grey , apart from a pale brown streak from the base of the bill to behind the eye , the belly is white , and the flanks , and undertail are barred with chestnut and white . the strong bill is flesh @-@ coloured , the iris is pale brown , and the legs and feet are pale grey . compared to the male , the female has warmer @-@ toned upperparts and a narrower duller eye streak . outside the breeding season , the upperparts of both sexes become darker and the underparts less grey . the juvenile is like the adult in appearance , but has a yellow tone to its upperparts , and the grey of the underparts is replaced with buff @-@ brown . the chicks have black down , as with all rails . while there are no subspecies , all populations show great individual variation in colouring , and the birds gradually become paler and greyer towards the east of the range . adults undergo a complete moult after breeding , which is normally finished by late august or early september , before migration to south eastern africa . there is a pre @-@ breeding partial moult prior to the return from africa , mainly involving the plumage of the head , body and tail . young birds have a head and body moult about five weeks after hatching . \\n  the corn crake is sympatric with the african crake on the wintering grounds , but can be distinguished by its larger size , paler upperparts , tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern . in flight , it has longer , less rounded wings , and shallower wingbeats than its african relative , and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing . in both the breeding and wintering ranges it is unlikely to be confused with any other rails , since sympatric species are smaller , with white markings on the upperparts , different underparts patterns and shorter bills . a flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird , but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic . \\n  = = = voice = = = \\n  on the breeding grounds , the male corn crake \\'s advertising call is a loud , repetitive , grating krek krek normally delivered from a low perch with the bird \\'s head and neck almost vertical and its bill wide open . the call can be heard from 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) away , and serves to establish the breeding territory , attract females , and challenge intruding males . slight differences in vocalisations mean that individual males can be distinguished by their calls . early in the season , the call is given almost continuously at night , and often during the day , too . it may be repeated more than 20 @,@ 000 times a night , with a peak between midnight and 3 am . the call has evolved to make a singing male \\'s location clear , as this species hides in vegetation . the frequency of calling reduces after a few weeks but may intensify again near the end of the laying period before falling away towards the end of the breeding season . to attract males , mechanical imitations of their call can be produced by rubbing a piece of wood down a notched stick , or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip @-@ fastener . the male also has a growling call , given with the bill shut and used during aggressive interactions . \\n  the female corn crake may give a call that is similar to that of the male ; it also has a distinctive barking sound , similar in rhythm to the main call but without the grating quality . the female also has a high @-@ pitched cheep call , and a oo @-@ oo @-@ oo sound to call the chick . the chicks make a quiet peeick @-@ peeick contact call , and a chirp used to beg for food . because of the difficulty in seeing this species , it is usually censused by counting males calling between 11 pm and 3 am ; the birds do not move much at night , whereas they may wander up to 600 m ( 660 yd ) during the day , which could lead to double @-@ counting if monitored then . identifying individual males suggests that just counting calling birds underestimates the true count by nearly 30 % , and the discrepancy is likely to be greater , since only 80 % of males may call at all on a given night . the corn crake is silent in africa . \\n  = = distribution and habitat = = \\n  the corn crake breeds from britain and ireland east through europe to central siberia . although it has vanished from much of its historic range , this bird was once found in suitable habitats in eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41 ° n and 62 ° n. there is also a sizable population in western china , but this species nests only rarely in northern spain and in turkey . old claims of breeding in south africa are incorrect , and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the african rail . \\n  the corn crake winters mainly in africa , from the democratic republic of the congo and central tanzania south to eastern south africa . north of this area , it is mainly seen on migration , but occasionally winters in north africa and to the west and north of its core area in southeast africa . most of the south african population of about 2 @,@ 000 birds occurs in kwazulu @-@ natal and the former transvaal province , and numbers elsewhere in africa are uncertain . there are several nineteenth @-@ century records , when populations were much higher than now , of birds being seen in western europe , mainly britain and ireland , between december and february . \\n  this crake migrates to africa along two main routes : a western route through morocco and algeria , and a more important flyway through egypt . on passage , it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges , including much of west africa . birds from coll following the western route paused in west africa on their way further south , and again on the return flight , when they also rested in spain or north africa . eastern migrants have been recorded in those parts of southern asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and africa . further afield , the corn crake has been recorded as a vagrant to sri lanka , vietnam and australia , the seychelles , bermuda , canada , the us , greenland , iceland , the faroes , the azores , madeira , and the canary islands . \\n  the corn crake is mainly a lowland species , but breeds up to 1 @,@ 400 m ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) altitude in the alps , 2 @,@ 700 m ( 8 @,@ 900 ft ) in china and 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) in russia . when breeding in eurasia , the corn crake \\'s habitats would originally have included river meadows with tall grass and meadow plants including sedges and irises . it is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay , particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use . it also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga , on coasts , or where created by fire . moister areas like wetland edges may be used , but very wet habitats are avoided , as are open areas and those with vegetation more than 50 cm ( 20 in ) tall , or too dense to walk through . the odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling post . grassland which is not mown or grazed becomes too matted to be suitable for nesting , but locally crops such as cereals , peas , rape , clover or potatoes may be used . after breeding , adults move to taller vegetation such as common reed , iris , or nettles to moult , returning to the hay and silage meadows for the second brood . in china , flax is also used for nest sites . although males often sing in intensively managed grass or cereal crops , successful breeding is uncommon , and nests in the field margins or nearby fallow ground are more likely to succeed . \\n  when wintering in africa , the corn crake occupies dry grassland and savanna habitats , occurring in vegetation 30 – 200 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 6 @.@ 56 ft ) tall , including seasonally burnt areas and occasionally sedges or reed beds . it is also found on fallow and abandoned fields , uncut grass on airfields , and the edges of crops . it occurs at up to at least 1 @,@ 750 metres ( 5 @,@ 740 ft ) altitude in south africa . each bird stays within a fairly small area . although it sometimes occurs with the african crake , that species normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the corn crake . on migration , the corn crake may also occur in wheatfields and around golf courses . \\n  = = behaviour = = \\n  the corn crake is a difficult bird to see in its breeding sites , usually being hidden by vegetation , but will sometimes emerge into the open . occasionally , individuals may become very trusting ; for five consecutive summers , an individual crake on the scottish island of tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps , and , in 1999 , a wintering barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished . in africa , it is more secretive than the african crake , and , unlike its relative , it is rarely seen in the open , although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides . the corn crake is most active early and late in the day , after heavy rain and during light rain . its typical flight is weak and fluttering , although less so than that of the african crake . for longer flights , such as migration , it has a steadier , stronger action with legs drawn up . it walks with a high @-@ stepping action , and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened . it will swim if essential . when flushed by a dog , it will fly less than 50 m ( 160 ft ) , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket , and then crouch on landing . if disturbed in the open , this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance , with its neck stretched forward , then stand upright to watch the intruder . when captured it may feign death , recovering at once if it sees a way out . \\n  the corn crake is solitary on the wintering grounds , where each bird occupies 4 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 9 ha ( 10 – 12 acres ) at one time , although the total area used may be double that , since an individual may move locally due to flooding , plant growth , or grass cutting . flocks of up to 40 birds may form on migration , sometimes associating with common quails . migration takes place at night , and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites . the ability to migrate is innate , not learned from adults . chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to africa and return with similar success to wild @-@ bred young . \\n  = = = breeding = = = \\n  until 1995 , it was assumed that the corn crake is monogamous , but it transpires that a male may have a shifting home range , and mate with two or more females , moving on when laying is almost complete . the male \\'s territory can vary from 3 to 51 ha ( 7 @.@ 4 to 126 @.@ 0 acres ) , but averages 15 @.@ 7 ha ( 39 acres ) . the female has a much smaller range , averaging only 5 @.@ 5 ha ( 14 acres ) . a male will challenge an intruder by calling with his wings drooped and his head pointing forward . usually the stranger moves off ; if it stays , the two birds square up with heads and necks raised and the wings touching the ground . they then run around giving the growling call and lunging at each other . a real fight may ensue , with the birds leaping at each other and pecking , and sometimes kicking . females play no part in defending the territory . \\n  the female may be offered food by the male during courtship . he has a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head held down , the tail is fanned , and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground . he will then attempt to approach the female from behind , and then leap on her back to copulate . the nest is typically in grassland , sometimes in safer sites along a hedge , or near an isolated tree or bush , or in overgrown vegetation . where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season , the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation , with the second brood in hay . the second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first , to take advantage of the later @-@ developing grasses further up a hill . the nest , well hidden in the grass , is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground . it is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants , and lined with finer grasses . although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female , a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest . \\n  the nest is 12 – 15 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter and 3 – 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) deep . the clutch is 6 – 14 , usually 8 – 12 eggs ; these are oval , slightly glossy , creamy or tinted with green , blue or grey , and blotched red @-@ brown . they average 37 mm × 26 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in × 1 @.@ 0 in ) and weigh about 13 – 16 g ( 0 @.@ 46 – 0 @.@ 56 oz ) , of which 7 % is shell . the eggs are laid at daily intervals , but second clutches may sometimes have two eggs added per day . incubation is by the female only ; her tendency to sit tight when disturbed , or wait until the last moment to flee , leads to many deaths during hay @-@ cutting and harvesting . the eggs hatch together after 19 – 20 days , and the precocial chicks leave the nest within a day or two . they are fed by the female for three or four days , but can find their own food thereafter . the juveniles fledge after 34 – 38 days . the second brood is started about 42 days after the first , and the incubation period is slightly shorter at 16 – 18 days . the grown young may stay with the female until departure for africa . \\n  nest success in undisturbed sites is high , at 80 – 90 % , but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land . the method and timing of mowing is crucial ; mechanized mowing can kill 38 – 95 % of chicks in a given site , and losses average 50 % of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40 % of second brood chicks . the influence of weather on chick survival is limited ; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather , the effects are relatively small . unlike many precocial species , chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent , and this may cushion them from adverse conditions . the number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather , with lower survival in large broods . the annual adult survival rate is under 30 % , although some individuals may live for 5 – 7 years . \\n  = = = feeding = = = \\n  the corn crake is omnivorous , but mainly feeds on invertebrates , including earthworms , slugs and snails , spiders , beetles , dragonflies , grasshoppers and other insects . in the breeding areas , it is a predator of sitona weevils , which infest legume crops. and in the past consumed large amounts of the former grassland pests , leatherjackets and wireworms . this crake will also eat small frogs and mammals , and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain . its diet on the wintering grounds is generally similar , but includes locally available items such as termites , cockroaches and dung beetles . food is taken from the ground , low @-@ growing plants and from inside grass tussocks ; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill , and run in pursuit of active prey . hunting is normally in cover , but , particularly in the wintering areas , it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads . indigestible material is regurgitated as 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) pellets . chicks are fed mainly on animal food , and when fully grown they may fly with the parents up to 6 @.@ 4 km ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) to visit supplementary feeding areas . as with other rails , grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach . \\n  = = predators and parasites = = \\n  predators on the breeding grounds include feral and domestic cats , introduced american mink , feral ferrets , otters and red foxes , and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow . in lithuania , the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded as taking corn crakes . when chicks are exposed by rapid mowing , they may be taken by large birds including the white stork , harriers and other birds of prey , gulls and corvids . at undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked , as reflected in a high breeding success . there is a record of a corn crake on migration through gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk . \\n  the widespread fluke prosthogonimus ovatus , which lives in the oviducts of birds , has been recorded in the corn crake , as have the parasitic worm plagiorchis elegans , the larvae of parasitic flies , and hard ticks of the genera haemaphysalis and ixodes . \\n  during the reintroduction of corn crakes to england in the 2003 breeding season , enteritis and ill health in pre @-@ release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic campylobacter species . subsequently , microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find the source of the bacteria in their environment . \\n  = = status = = \\n  until 2010 , despite a breeding range estimated at 12 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 km2 ( 4 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , the corn crake was classified as near threatened on the iucn red list because of serious declines in europe , but improved monitoring in russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased . it is therefore now classed as least concern , since the major populations in russia and kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term . there are an estimated 1 @.@ 3 – 2 @.@ 0 million breeding pairs in europe , three @-@ quarters of which are in european russia , and a further 515 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 240 @,@ 000 pairs in asiatic russia ; the total eurasian population has been estimated at between 5 @.@ 45 and 9 @.@ 72 million individuals . in much of the western half of its range , there have been long @-@ term declines that are expected to continue , although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries , including a five @-@ fold increase in finland , and a doubling in the uk . in the netherlands , there were 33 breeding territories in 1996 , but this number had increased to at least 500 by 1998 . \\n  the breeding corn crake population had begun to decline in the 19th century , but the process gained pace after world war ii . the main cause of the steep declines in much of europe is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing . haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth , made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers , and the move from manual grass @-@ cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers , at first horse @-@ drawn and later pulled by tractors . mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly , leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone , or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed . the pattern of mowing , typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre , gives little chance of escape for the chicks , which are also exposed to potential animal predators . adults can often escape the mowers , although some incubating females sit tight on the nest , with fatal results . \\n  loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake . apart from the reduced suitability of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows , in western europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies , and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area . more localised threats include floods in spring , and disturbance by roads or wind farms . this bird is good eating ; when they were common in england , mrs beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer . more significant than direct hunting is the loss of many birds , up to 14 @,@ 000 a year , in egypt , where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate . although this may account for 0 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 7 % of the european population , the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable . \\n  most european countries have taken steps to conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies ; there is also an overall european action plan . the focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival , principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting . later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed , and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing . implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale . reduction of illegal hunting , and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed , are also conservation aims . reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in england , and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries . where breeding sites impinge on urban areas , there are cost implications , estimated in one german study at several million euros per corn crake . the corn crake does not appear to be seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation , which creates more open habitats . \\n  = = in culture = = \\n  most rails are secretive wetland birds that have made little cultural impression , but as a formerly common farmland bird with a loud nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers , the corn crake has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature . \\n  = = = names = = = \\n  the favoured name for this species among naturalists has changed over the years , with \" landrail \" and variants of \" corncrake \" being preferred at various times . \" crake gallinule \" also had a period of popularity between 1768 and 1813 . the originally older scots \" cornecrake \" was popularised by thomas bewick , who used this term in his 1797 a history of british birds . other scots names include \" corn scrack \" and \" quailzie \" ; the latter term , like \" king of the quail \" , \" grass quail \" , the french \" roi de caille \" , and the german \" wachtelkönig \" refer to the association with the small gamebird . another name , \" daker \" , has been variously interpreted as onomatopoeic , or derived from the old norse ager @-@ hoene , meaning \" cock of the field \" ; variants include \" drake \" , \" drake hen \" and \" gorse drake \" . \\n  = = = in literature = = = \\n  corn crakes are the subject of three stanzas of the seventeenth century poet andrew marvell \\'s \" upon appleton house \" , written in 1651 about the north yorkshire country estate of thomas fairfax . the narrator depicts the scene of a mower cutting the grass , before his \" whistling sithe \" unknowingly \" carves the rail \" . the farmhand draws out the scythe \" all bloody from its breast \" and \" does the stroke detest \" . it continues with a stanza that demonstrates the problematic nature of the corn crake \\'s nesting habits : \\n  john clare , the nineteenth @-@ century english poet based in northamptonshire , wrote \" the landrail \" , a semi @-@ comic piece which is primarily about the difficulty of seeing corn crakes – as opposed to hearing them . in the fourth verse he exclaims : \" tis like a fancy everywhere / a sort of living doubt \" . clare wrote about corn crakes in his prose works too , and his writings help to clarify the distribution of this rail when it was far more widespread than now . \\n  the finnish poet eino leino also wrote about the bird in his poem \" nocturne \" . \\n  the proverbial use of the corn crake \\'s call to describe someone with a grating or unmelodious voice is illustrated in the quotation \" thanks to a wee woman with a voice like a corncrake who believed she was an apprentice angel \" . this usage dates from at least the first half of the nineteenth century , and continues through to the present . \\n  = acute myeloid leukemia = \\n  acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( anll ) , is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells , characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells . aml is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults , and its incidence increases with age . although aml is a relatively rare disease , accounting for roughly 1 @.@ 2 % of cancer deaths in the united states , its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages . \\n  the symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells , which causes a drop in red blood cells , platelets , and normal white blood cells . these symptoms include fatigue , shortness of breath , easy bruising and bleeding , and increased risk of infection . several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified , but the specific cause is not clear . as an acute leukemia , aml progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated . \\n  aml has several subtypes ; treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes . aml is cured in 35 – 40 % of people less than 60 years old and 5 – 15 % more than 60 years old . older people who are not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of 5 – 10 months . \\n  aml is treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at inducing a remission ; people may go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant . recent research into the genetics of aml has resulted in the availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person , as well as how long that person is likely to survive . the treatment and prognosis of aml differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same ; aml involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells , including more blasts ( myeloblasts , monoblasts , and megakaryoblasts ) . \\n  = = signs and symptoms = = \\n  most signs and symptoms of aml are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells . a lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections ; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors , they have no infection @-@ fighting capacity . a drop in red blood cell count ( anemia ) can cause fatigue , paleness , and shortness of breath . a lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma . \\n  the early signs of aml are often vague and nonspecific , and may be similar to those of influenza or other common illnesses . some generalized symptoms include fever , fatigue , weight loss or loss of appetite , shortness of breath , anemia , easy bruising or bleeding , petechiae ( flat , pin @-@ head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding ) , bone and joint pain , and persistent or frequent infections . \\n  enlargement of the spleen may occur in aml , but it is typically mild and asymptomatic . lymph node swelling is rare in aml , in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia . the skin is involved about 10 % of the time in the form of leukemia cutis . rarely , sweet \\'s syndrome , a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin , can occur with aml . \\n  some people with aml may experience swelling of the gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue . rarely , the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow , called a chloroma . occasionally , a person may show no symptoms , and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test . \\n  = = risk factors = = \\n  a number of risk factors for developing aml have been identified , including : other blood disorders , chemical exposures , ionizing radiation , and genetics . \\n  = = = preleukemia = = = \\n  \" preleukemic \" blood disorders , such as myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) or myeloproliferative disease ( mps ) , can evolve into aml ; the exact risk depends on the type of mds / mps . \\n  = = = chemical exposure = = = \\n  exposure to anticancer chemotherapy , in particular alkylating agents , can increase the risk of subsequently developing aml . the risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy . other chemotherapy agents , specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines , have also been associated with treatment @-@ related leukemias , which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells . \\n  occupational chemical exposure to benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial as a cause of aml . benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro . while some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of aml , others have suggested the attributable risk , if any , is slight . \\n  = = = radiation = = = \\n  high amounts of ionizing radiation exposure can increase the risk of aml . survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had an increased rate of aml , as did radiologists exposed to high levels of x @-@ rays prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices . people treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer , non @-@ hodgkin lymphoma , lung cancer and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring aml , but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years . \\n  = = = genetics = = = \\n  a hereditary risk for aml appears to exist . multiple cases of aml developing in a family at a rate higher than predicted by chance alone have been reported . several congenital conditions may increase the risk of leukemia ; the most common is probably down syndrome , which is associated with a 10- to 18 @-@ fold increase in the risk of aml . \\n  = = diagnosis = = \\n  the first clue to a diagnosis of aml is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count . while an excess of abnormal white blood cells ( leukocytosis ) is a common finding , and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen , aml can also present with isolated decreases in platelets , red blood cells , or even with a low white blood cell count ( leukopenia ) . while a presumptive diagnosis of aml can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts , a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy . \\n  marrow or blood is examined under light microscopy , as well as flow cytometry , to diagnose the presence of leukemia , to differentiate aml from other types of leukemia ( e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - all ) , and to classify the subtype of disease . a sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization . genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as flt3 , nucleophosmin , and kit , which may influence the outcome of the disease . \\n  cytochemical stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the distinction of aml from all , and in subclassification of aml . the combination of a myeloperoxidase or sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases . the myeloperoxidase or sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of aml and distinguishing it from all . the nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in amls and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from all . \\n  the diagnosis and classification of aml can be challenging , and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist . in straightforward cases , the presence of certain morphologic features ( such as auer rods ) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish aml from other leukemias ; however , in the absence of such features , diagnosis may be more difficult . \\n  the two most commonly used classification schemata for aml are the older french @-@ american @-@ british ( fab ) system and the newer world health organization ( who ) system . according to the widely used who criteria , the diagnosis of aml is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20 % of the blood and / or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts , except in the three best prognosis forms of aml with recurrent genetic abnormalities ( t ( 8 ; 21 ) , inv ( 16 ) , and t ( 15 ; 17 ) ) in which the presence of the genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent . the french – american – british ( fab ) classification is a bit more stringent , requiring a blast percentage of at least 30 % in bone marrow ( bm ) or peripheral blood ( pb ) for the diagnosis of aml . aml must be carefully differentiated from \" preleukemic \" conditions such as myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes , which are treated differently . \\n  because acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) has the highest curability and requires a unique form of treatment , it is important to quickly establish or exclude the diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia . fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose , as it readily identifies the chromosomal translocation [ t ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; q12 ) ; ] that characterizes apl . there is also a need to molecularly detect the presence of pml / rara fusion protein , which is an oncogenic product of that translocation . \\n  = = = world health organization = = = \\n  the who 2008 classification of acute myeloid leukemia attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more meaningful prognostic information than the fab criteria . each of the who categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories of interest to the hematopathologist and oncologist ; however , most of the clinically significant information in the who schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below . \\n  the who subtypes of aml are : \\n  acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage ( also known as mixed phenotype or biphenotypic acute leukemia ) occur when the leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells , or where both types of cells are present . \\n  = = = french @-@ american @-@ british = = = \\n  the french @-@ american @-@ british ( fab ) classification system divides aml into eight subtypes , m0 through to m7 , based on the type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity . this is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and / or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities . the subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy . although the who classification ( see above ) may be more useful , the fab system is still widely used . \\n  eight fab subtypes were proposed in 1976 . \\n  the morphologic subtypes of aml also include rare types not included in the fab system , such as acute basophilic leukemia , which was proposed as a ninth subtype , m8 , in 1999 . \\n  = = pathophysiology = = \\n  the malignant cell in aml is the myeloblast . in normal hematopoiesis , the myeloblast is an immature precursor of myeloid white blood cells ; a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell . in aml , though , a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which \" freeze \" the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation . such a mutation alone does not cause leukemia ; however , when such a \" differentiation arrest \" is combined with other mutations which disrupt genes controlling proliferation , the result is the uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells , leading to the clinical entity of aml . \\n  much of the diversity and heterogeneity of aml stems is because leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway . modern classification schemes for aml recognize the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell ( and the leukemia ) may depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted . \\n  specific cytogenetic abnormalities can be found in many people with aml ; the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance . the chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins , usually transcription factors whose altered properties may cause the \" differentiation arrest \" . for example , in acute promyelocytic leukemia , the t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation produces a pml @-@ rarα fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid @-@ specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation . \\n  the clinical signs and symptoms of aml result from the growth of leukemic clone cells , which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow . this leads to neutropenia , anemia , and thrombocytopenia . the symptoms of aml are , in turn , often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements . in rare cases , people with aml can develop a chloroma , or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow , which can cause various symptoms depending on its location . \\n  an important pathophysiological mechanism of leukemogenesis in aml is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter the function of epigenetic enzymes , such as the dna demethylase tet2 and the metabolic enzymes idh1 and idh2 , which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite , d @-@ 2 @-@ hydroxyglutarate , which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as tet2 . the hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and / or the activation of proto @-@ oncogenes . \\n  = = treatment = = \\n  first @-@ line treatment of aml consists primarily of chemotherapy , and is divided into two phases : induction and postremission ( or consolidation ) therapy . the goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level ; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure . hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses , although transplantation is also sometimes used as front @-@ line therapy for people with high @-@ risk disease . efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in aml continue . \\n  = = = induction = = = \\n  all fab subtypes except m3 are usually given induction chemotherapy with cytarabine ( ara @-@ c ) and an anthracycline ( most often daunorubicin ) . this induction chemotherapy regimen is known as \" 7 + 3 \" ( or \" 3 + 7 \" ) , because the cytarabine is given as a continuous iv infusion for seven consecutive days while the anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an iv push . up to 70 % of people with aml will achieve a remission with this protocol . other alternative induction regimens , including high @-@ dose cytarabine alone , flag @-@ like regimens or investigational agents , may also be used . because of the toxic effects of therapy , including myelosuppression and an increased risk of infection , induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very elderly , and the options may include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care . \\n  the m3 subtype of aml , also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , is almost universally treated with the drug all @-@ trans @-@ retinoic acid ( atra ) in addition to induction chemotherapy , usually an anthracycline . care must be taken to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) , complicating the treatment of apl when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation . apl is eminently curable , with well @-@ documented treatment protocols . \\n  the goal of the induction phase is to reach a complete remission . complete remission does not mean the disease has been cured ; rather , it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods . complete remission is obtained in about 50 % – 75 % of newly diagnosed adults , although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above . the length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia . in general , all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy . \\n  = = = consolidation = = = \\n  even after complete remission is achieved , leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be detected with current diagnostic techniques . if no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given , almost all people with aml will eventually relapse . therefore , more therapy is necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse — that is , to achieve a cure . \\n  the specific type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person \\'s prognostic factors ( see above ) and general health . for good @-@ prognosis leukemias ( i.e. inv ( 16 ) , t ( 8 ; 21 ) , and t ( 15 ; 17 ) ) , people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy , known as consolidation chemotherapy . for people at high risk of relapse ( e.g. those with high @-@ risk cytogenetics , underlying mds , or therapy @-@ related aml ) , allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor . the best postremission therapy for intermediate @-@ risk aml ( normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good @-@ risk or high @-@ risk groups ) is less clear and depends on the specific situation , including the age and overall health of the person , the person \\'s values , and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available . \\n  for people who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant , immunotherapy with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride ( ceplene ) and interleukin 2 ( proleukin ) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14 % , translating to a 50 % increase in the likelihood of maintained remission . \\n  = = = relapsed aml = = = \\n  for people with relapsed aml , the only proven potentially curative therapy is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant , if one has not already been performed . in 2000 , the monoclonal antibody @-@ linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( mylotarg ) was approved in the united states for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed aml who are not candidates for high @-@ dose chemotherapy . this drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer , pfizer in 2010 . \\n  since treatment options for relapsed aml are so limited , palliative care or enrolment in a clinical trial may be offered . \\n  for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , arsenic trioxide is approved by the us fda . like atra , arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of aml . \\n  = = prognosis = = \\n  acute myeloid leukemia is a curable disease ; the chance of cure for a specific person depends on a number of prognostic factors . \\n  = = = cytogenetics = = = \\n  the single most important prognostic factor in aml is cytogenetics , or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell . certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes ( for example , the ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia ) . about half of people with aml have \" normal \" cytogenetics ; they fall into an intermediate risk group . a number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment . \\n  the first publication to address cytogenetics and prognosis was the mrc trial of 1998 : \\n  later , the southwest oncology group and eastern cooperative oncology group and , later still , cancer and leukemia group b published other , mostly overlapping lists of cytogenetics prognostication in leukemia . \\n  = = = myelodysplastic syndrome = = = \\n  aml which arises from a pre @-@ existing myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) or myeloproliferative disease ( so @-@ called secondary aml ) has a worse prognosis , as does treatment @-@ related aml arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy . both of these entities are associated with a high rate of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities . \\n  = = = other prognostic markers = = = \\n  in some studies , age > 60 years and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level were also associated with poorer outcomes . as with most forms of cancer , performance status ( i.e. the general physical condition and activity level of the person ) plays a major role in prognosis as well . \\n  = = = = genotype = = = = \\n  a large number of molecular alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in aml . however , only flt3 @-@ itd , npm1 , cebpa and c @-@ kit are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema . these are expected to increase rapidly in the near future . flt3 internal tandem duplications ( itds ) have been shown to confer a poorer prognosis in aml with normal cytogenetics . several flt3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials , with mixed results . two other mutations - npm1 and biallelic cebpa are associated with improved outcomes , especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms . \\n  researchers are investigating the clinical significance of c @-@ kit mutations in aml . these are prevalent , and potentially clinically relevant because of the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c @-@ kit pharmacologically . it is expected that additional markers ( e.g. , runx1 , asxl1 , and tp53 ) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations . the prognostic importance of other mutated genes ( e.g. , dnmt3a , idh1 , idh2 ) is less clear . \\n  = = = expectation of cure = = = \\n  cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from 20 – 45 % ; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies . the overall cure rate for all people with aml ( including the elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy ) is likely lower . cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can be as high as 98 % . \\n  = = epidemiology = = \\n  acute myeloid leukemia is a relatively rare cancer . there are approximately 10 @,@ 500 new cases each year in the united states , and the incidence rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005 . aml accounts for 1 @.@ 2 % of all cancer deaths in the united states . \\n  the incidence of aml increases with age ; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years . aml accounts for about 90 % of all acute leukemias in adults , but is rare in children . the rate of therapy @-@ related aml ( that is , aml caused by previous chemotherapy ) is rising ; therapy @-@ related disease currently accounts for about 10 – 20 % of all cases of aml . aml is slightly more common in men , with a male @-@ to @-@ female ratio of 1 @.@ 3 : 1 . \\n  there is some geographic variation in the incidence of aml . in adults , the highest rates are seen in north america , europe , and oceania , while adult aml is rarer in asia and latin america . in contrast , childhood aml is less common in north america and india than in other parts of asia . these differences may be due to population genetics , environmental factors , or a combination of the two . \\n  = = = uk = = = \\n  aml accounts for 34 % of all leukaemia cases in the uk , and around 2 @,@ 900 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011 . \\n  = = history = = \\n  the first published description of a case of leukemia in medical literature dates to 1827 , when french physician alfred @-@ armand @-@ louis @-@ marie velpeau described a 63 @-@ year @-@ old florist who developed an illness characterized by fever , weakness , urinary stones , and substantial enlargement of the liver and spleen . velpeau noted the blood of this person had a consistency \" like gruel \" , and speculated the appearance of the blood was due to white corpuscles . in 1845 , a series of people who died with enlarged spleens and changes in the \" colors and consistencies of their blood \" was reported by the edinburgh @-@ based pathologist j.h. bennett ; he used the term \" leucocythemia \" to describe this pathological condition . \\n  the term \" leukemia \" was coined by rudolf virchow , the renowned german pathologist , in 1856 . as a pioneer in the use of the light microscope in pathology , virchow was the first to describe the abnormal excess of white blood cells in people with the clinical syndrome described by velpeau and bennett . as virchow was uncertain of the etiology of the white blood cell excess , he used the purely descriptive term \" leukemia \" ( greek : \" white blood \" ) to refer to the condition . \\n  further advances in the understanding of acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology . in 1877 , paul ehrlich developed a technique of staining blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells . wilhelm ebstein introduced the term \" acute leukemia \" in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more indolent chronic leukemias . the term \" myeloid \" was coined by franz ernst christian neumann in 1869 , as he was the first to recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow ( greek : µυєλός , myelos = ( bone ) marrow ) as opposed to the spleen . the technique of bone marrow examination to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by mosler . finally , in 1900 , the myeloblast , which is the malignant cell in aml , was characterized by otto naegeli , who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic . \\n  in 2008 , aml became the first cancer genome to be fully sequenced . dna extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin . the leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease . \\n  = = pregnancy = = \\n  leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy , affecting only about 1 in 10 @,@ 000 pregnant women . how it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia . acute leukemias normally require prompt , aggressive treatment , despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects , especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester . \\n  = love

culture . \" the new york times quoted xinjiang daily saying in may that 70 percent of the young uyghurs had \" signed up for employment voluntarily . \" however , kashgar residents say the families of those who refuse to go are threatened with fines of up to six months \\' worth of a villager \\'s income . \\n  an official in charge of ethnic and religious affairs in guangdong said that the province had hired uygurs , aged from 18 to 29 , in may . a small group of uyghurs arrived on 2 may , and workers at the factory remarked that relations between the two groups deteriorated as the number of uyghurs increased . state media confirmed that all the workers were from shufu county . china labor watch reported that workers at the shaoguan factory , where the uyghurs were employed , earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41 @.@ 3 yuan in its factory in shenzhen . they noted that rights of workers , han and uyghur alike , were frequently violated by verbal abuse from factory supervisors , unpaid overtime , poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts . li qiang , executive director of china labor watch said that low pay , long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the han and uyghurs . \\n  = = causes and events = = \\n  overnight on 25 – 26 june , tensions

injured , 79 were uyghurs and 39 were hans . 400 police and 50 anti @-@ riot vehicles were mobilised . \\n  official sources state that the rioting began at around 2 a.m. , and there were reports that they lasted until at least 4 @.@ 30 a.m. , when police arrived . an initial disturbance was reported at around 11 p.m. when security guards responded to a call for help by a female worker who felt intimidated by several chanting male uyghurs . two dozen han workers armed with batons and metal rods then responded ; they called for backup using their phones . \\n  uyghurs maintained that the attacks started after the night shift at around 12 @.@ 30 a.m. , when han mobs stormed into uyghur dormitories and started indiscriminate and unprovoked beatings . amateur videos posted online showed brutal attacks , and han chasing uyghurs through the dorm floors . one man said that he saw that security had been overwhelmed by the arrival of outside gangs ; he said it was common knowledge that the outsiders brought in machetes . han and uyghur witnesses interviewed by the foreign press thought the casualties had been understated by the authorities : a han claimed to have killed seven or eight uyghurs ; uyghurs cited \" merciless \" assaults on those already in ambulances . the rioting stopped soon after the police arrived . a policeman explained their delay in arriving at the scene due to difficulties in assembling enough officers . the two dead men were later named as aximujiang aimaiti and sadikejiang kaze , both from xinjiang . \\n  = = = rape rumours = = = \\n  the rioting was sparked by allegations of sexual assault on han women by uyghurs , and rumours of an incident in which two female han workers were sexually assaulted by six uyghur co @-@ workers at the factory ,

protests in ürümqi were assembled by email . xinhua reported that guangdong authorities had arrested two people who are suspected of having spread rumours online which alleged sexual assault of han women had taken place . in addition , it reported on 7 july 2009 that 13 suspects had been taken into custody following the incident , of which 3 were uyghurs from xinjiang . xinhua quoted 23 @-@ year @-@ old huang jiangyuan saying that he was angry at being turned down for a job in june at the toy factory , and thus posted an article at a forum on sg169.com on 16 june which alleged six xinjiang

. kang zhijian , vice director with the shaoguan public security bureau , said that the offenders would face up to 15 days in administrative detention . \\n  on 8 july 2009 , xinhua released an interview with huang cuilian , the \" han girl \" whose alleged rape triggered the disturbances . the 19 @-@ year @-@ old trainee from rural guangdong , who had worked at the factory less than two months , said : \" i was lost and entered the wrong dormitory and screamed when i saw those uyghur young men in the room ... i just felt they were unfriendly so i turned and ran . \" she recounted how one of them stood up and stamped his feet as if to chase her . \" i later realized that he was just making fun of me . \" she said she only found out hours later that she was the cause of the violence . \\n  shaoguan authorities moved the uyghur workers to temporary accommodation , and the workers were transferred on 7 july to another facility belonging to early light , 30 km away in baitu town . the baitu factory is now reported to be an uyghur enclave , with , sporting facilities , canteen serving xinjiang food , a round @-@ the @-@ clock staff clinic , and plain @-@ clothed police officers in their midst . according to the south china morning post , the kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix with colleagues in their previous location because of the language barrier – a local shop worker estimated that less than one in three spoke mandarin . two months on , the south china morning post found few willing to talk about the events of the fateful night . the authorities \\' claims that 50 uyghur workers were granted their repatriation requests following the violence are contested by uyghur workers . \\n  abdukeyum muhammat , deputy secretary of xinjiang kanji prefectural committee of the communist party , led a working team to shaoguan on 27 june . zhou yongkang , politburo standing committee member responsible for security , reportedly visited shaoguan in early september 2009 . on 5 august , xinhua reported that chinese police had arrested kurban khayum , a chef at an arabic restaurant in guangzhou who they claimed confessed to being an agent for the world uygur congress ( wuc ) and who allegedly spread rumours that were later used as a pretext to trigger the ürümqi riots of 5 july . xinhua alleged that he had fabricated a report that \" the factory

\\'s first european settlements on the island were constructed around 1816 by french pirate louis @-@ michel aury to help the fledgling republic of mexico fight spain . the port of galveston was established in 1825 by the congress of mexico following its successful independence from spain . the city served as the main port for the texas navy during the texas revolution , and later served as the capital of the republic of texas . \\n  during the 19th century , galveston became a major u.s. commercial center and one of the largest ports in the united states . it was devastated by the 1900 galveston hurricane , whose effects included flooding and a storm surge . the natural disaster on the exposed barrier island is still ranked as the deadliest in united states history , with an

explorer cabeza de vaca and his crew were shipwrecked on the island or nearby in november 1528 , calling it \" isla de malhado \" ( \" isle of bad fate \" ) . they began their years @-@ long trek to a spanish settlement in mexico city . during his charting of the gulf coast in 1785 , the spanish explorer josé de evia named the island gálvez @-@ town or gálveztown in honor of bernardo de gálvez y madrid , count of gálvez . \\n  the first permanent european settlements on the island were constructed around 1816 by the pirate louis @-@ michel aury as a base of operations to support mexico \\'s rebellion against spain . in 1817 , aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against spain to find galveston occupied by the pirate jean lafitte . lafitte organized galveston into a pirate \" kingdom \" he called \" campeche \" , anointing himself the island \\'s \" head of government . \" lafitte remained in galveston until 1821 , when he and his raiders were forced off the island by the united states navy . \\n  in 1825 the congress of mexico established the port of galveston and in 1830 erected a customs house . galveston served as the capital of the republic of texas when in 1836 the interim president david g. burnet relocated his government there . in 1836 , the french @-@ canadian michel branamour menard and several associates purchased 4 @,@ 605 acres ( 18 @.@ 64 km2 ) of land for $ 50 @,@ 000 to found the town that would become the modern city of galveston . as anglo @-@ americans migrated to the city , they brought along or purchased enslaved african @-@ americans , some of whom worked domestically or on the waterfront , including on riverboats . \\n  in 1839 the city of galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the congress of the republic of texas . the city was by then a burgeoning port of entry and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of german immigrants to texas , including jewish merchants . together with ethnic mexican residents , these groups tended to oppose slavery , support the union during the civil war , and join the republican party after the war . \\n  during this expansion , the city had many \" firsts \" in the state , with the founding of institutions and adoption of inventions : post office ( 1836 ) , naval base ( 1836 ) , texas chapter of a masonic order ( 1840 ) ; cotton compress ( 1842 ) , catholic parochial school ( ursuline academy ) ( 1847 ) , insurance company ( 1854 ) , and gas lights ( 1856 ) . \\n  during the american civil war , confederate forces under major general john b. magruder attacked and expelled occupying union troops from the city in january 1863 in the battle of galveston . in 1867 galveston suffered a yellow fever epidemic ; 1800 people died in the city . these occurred in waterfront and river cities throughout the 19th century , as did cholera epidemics . \\n  the city \\'s progress continued through the reconstruction era with numerous \" firsts \" : construction of the opera house ( 1870 ) , and orphanage ( 1876 ) , and installation of telephone lines ( 1878 ) and electric lights ( 1883 ) . having attracted freedmen from rural areas , in 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 3 @,@ 000 , made up mostly of former slaves but also by numerous persons who were free men of color and educated before the war . the \" blacks \" comprised nearly 25 % of the city \\'s population of 13 @,@ 818 that year . \\n  during the post @-@ civil @-@ war period , leaders such as george t. ruby and norris wright cuney , who headed the texas republican party and promoted civil rights for freedmen , helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in galveston and in texas . cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs . galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during reconstruction ; the freedmen \\'s bureau was headquartered here . german families sheltered teachers from the north , and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read . its business community promoted progress , and immigrants continued to stay after arriving at this port of entry . \\n  by the end of the 19th century , the city of galveston had a population of 37 @,@ 000 . its position on the natural harbor of galveston bay along the gulf of mexico made it the center of trade in texas . it was one of the largest cotton ports in the nation , in competition with new orleans . throughout the 19th century , the port city of galveston grew rapidly and the strand was considered the region \\'s primary business center . for a time , the strand was known as the \" wall street of the south \" . in the late 1890s , the government constructed fort crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries in galveston and along the bolivar roads . in february 1897 , galveston was officially visited by the uss texas ( nicknamed old hoodoo ) , the first commissioned battleship of the united states navy . during the festivities , the ship \\'s officers were presented with a $ 5 @,@ 000 silver service , adorned with various texas motifs , as a gift from the citizens of the state . \\n  = = = hurricane of 1900 and recovery = = = \\n  on september 8 , 1900 , the island was struck by a devastating hurricane . this event holds the record as the united states \\' deadliest natural disaster . the city was devastated , and an estimated 6 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 people on the island were killed . following the storm , a 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) long , 17 foot ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) high seawall was constructed to protect the city from floods and hurricane storm surge . a team of engineers including henry martyn robert ( robert \\'s rules of order ) designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintained . \\n  the city developed the city commission form of city government , known as the \" galveston plan \" , to help expedite recovery . \\n  despite attempts to draw new investment to the city after the hurricane , galveston never fully returned to its previous levels of national importance or prosperity . development was also hindered by the construction of the houston ship channel , which brought the port of houston into direct competition with the natural harbor of the port of galveston for sea traffic . to further her recovery , and rebuild her population , galveston actively solicited immigration . through the efforts of rabbi henry cohen and congregation b \\'nai israel , galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the galveston movement that , between 1907 and 1914 , diverted roughly 10 @,@ 000 eastern european jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the northeastern united states . additionally numerous other immigrant groups , including greeks , italians and russian jews , came to the city during this period . this immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island , as well as many other areas of texas and the western u.s. \\n  though the storm stalled economic development and the city of houston developed as the region \\'s principal metropolis , galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port @-@ related industries . in 1905 william lewis moody , jr. and isaac h. kempner , members of two of galveston \\'s leading families , founded the american national insurance company . two years later , moody established the city national bank , which would later become the moody national bank . \\n  during the 1920s and 1930s , the city re @-@ emerged as a major tourist destination . under the influence of sam maceo and rosario maceo , the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the balinese room , which offered entertainment to wealthy houstonians and other out @-@ of @-@ towners . combined with prostitution , which had existed in the city since the civil war , galveston became known as the \" sin city \" of the gulf . galvestonians accepted and supported the illegal activities , often referring to their island as the \" free state of galveston \" . the island had entered what would later become known as the \" open era \" . \\n  the 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the island city . during world war ii , the galveston municipal airport , predecessor to scholes international airport , was re @-@ designated a u.s. army air corps base and named \" galveston army air field \" . in january 1943 , galveston army air field was officially activated with the 46th bombardment group serving an anti @-@ submarine role in the gulf of mexico . in 1942 , william lewis moody , jr . , along with his wife libbie shearn rice moody , established the moody foundation , to benefit \" present and future generations of texans . \" the foundation , one of the largest in the united states , would play a prominent role in galveston during later decades , helping to fund numerous civic and health @-@ oriented programs . \\n  = = = post – world war ii = = = \\n  the end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island . increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of las vegas , nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island . finally in 1957 , texas attorney general will wilson and the texas rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city . as these vice industries crashed , so did tourism , taking the rest of the galveston economy with it . neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward . \\n  the economy of the island entered a long stagnant period . many businesses relocated off the island during this period ; however , health care , insurance and financial industries continue to be strong contributors to the economy . by 1959 , the city of houston had long out @-@ paced galveston in population and economic growth . beginning in 1957 , the galveston historical foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings . the 1966 book the galveston that was helped encourage the preservation movement . restoration efforts financed by motivated investors , notably houston businessman george p. mitchell , gradually developed the strand historic district and reinvented other areas . a new , family @-@ oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years . \\n  with the 1960s came the expansion of higher education in galveston . already home to the university of texas medical branch , the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the texas maritime academy , predecessor of texas a & m university at galveston ; and by 1967 a community college , galveston college , had been established . \\n  in the 2000s , property values rose after expensive projects were completed and demand for second homes by the wealthy increased . it has made it difficult for middle @-@ class workers to find affordable housing on the island . \\n  hurricane ike made landfall on galveston island in the early morning of september 13 , 2008 as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 miles per hour . damage was extensive to buildings along the seawall . \\n  after the storm , the island was rebuilt with further investments into tourism , shipping , and continued emphasis on higher education and health care . notably the addition of the galveston island historic pleasure pier and the replacement of the bascule @-@ type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical @-@ lift @-@ type drawbridge to allow heavier freight . \\n  = =

old city / central business district , san jacinto , east end , and lindale . as of 2009 many residents of the west end use golf carts as transportation to take them to and from residential houses , the galveston island country club , and stores . in 2009 , chief of police charles wiley said he believed that golf carts should be prohibited outside golf courses , and west end residents campaigned against any ban on their use . \\n  in 2011 rice university released a study , \" atlas of sustainable strategies for galveston island , \" which argued that the west end of galveston was quickly eroding and that the city should reduce construction and / or population in that area . it recommended against any rebuilding of the west end in the event of damage due to another hurricane . scientists increasingly recognize that barrier islands are inherently unstable and cannot be permanently fixed . \\n  = = = historic districts = = = \\n  galveston is home to six historic districts

population of 72 @,@ 366 . it is the largest city on lake huron and in lambton county . sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the upper and lower great lakes where lake huron flows into the st. clair river , which forms the canada @-@ united states border , directly across from port huron , michigan . the city \\'s natural harbour first attracted the french explorer la salle , who named the site \" the rapids \" when he had horses and men pull his 45 tonnes ( 50 short tons ; 44 long tons ) barque \" le griffon \" up the almost four @-@ knot current of the st. clair river on 23 august 1679 . \\n  this was the first time anything other than a canoe or other oar @-@ powered vessel had sailed into lake huron , and la salle \\'s voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the great lakes . located in the natural harbour , the sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products . the natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas , together with the oil discovered in nearby oil springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area . because oil springs was the first place in canada and north america to drill commercially for oil , the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil . \\n  the complex of refining and chemical companies is called chemical valley and located south of downtown sarnia . the city has the highest level of particulates air pollution of any canadian city because of its reliance on the petrochemical industry . about 60 percent of the particulate matter , however , comes from the neighboring united states . lake huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter ; therefore , it moderates sarnia \\'s humid continental climate , which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold very rare . in the winter , sarnia experiences lake @-@ effect snow because arctic air blows across the warmer waters of lake huron and condenses to form snow squalls once over land . \\n  culturally , sarnia is a large part of the artistic presence in southern ontario . the city \\'s international symphony orchestra is renowned in the area and has won the outstanding community orchestra award given by the detroit music awards in 2011 . michael learned graced the stage of the imperial theatre for a 2010 production of driving miss daisy . the largest event that happens in sarnia is sarnia bayfest , which is a popular music festival that takes place during the summer . in 2013 , organizers cancelled the event because of money troubles but look forward in 2015 to combining with the international powerboat festival and presenting a joint event . \\n  = = name = = \\n  the name \" sarnia \" is latin for guernsey , which is a british channel island . in 1829 sir john colborne , a former governor of guernsey , was appointed lieutenant governor of upper canada . in this capacity , he visited two small settlements in 1835 that had been laid out on the shores of lake huron . one of these , named \" the rapids , \" consisted then of 44 taxpayers , nine frame houses , four log houses , two brick dwellings , two taverns and three stores . the villagers wished to change its name but were unable to agree on an alternative . the english settlers favoured the name \" buenos aires \" and the scottish \" new glasgow \" . sir john colborne suggested port sarnia . on 4 january 1836 , the name was formally adopted by a vote of 26 to 16 , and colborne also named the nearby village moore after british military hero sir john moore . sarnia adopted the nickname \" the imperial city \" on 7 may 1914 because of the visit of canada \\'s governor general , h.r.h. the duke of connaught , and his daughter princess patricia . \\n  = = history = = \\n  first nations peoples have lived , hunted , and traveled across the area for at least 10 @,@ 000 years , as shown by archaeological evidence on walpole island . these peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of ojibwa , odawa , and potowatami clans , which formed the three fires confederacy , also called the council of three fires , in a.d.796. these clans came together through common links in both language and culture , developing a self @-@ sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members . \\n  during the 1600s and 1700s , the three fires confederacy controlled much of the area known as the hub of the great lakes , which included the canadian shore where sarnia is now located . during this time , it maintained relations with many of the first nations , including huron , sioux , and iroquois , as well as the countries of great britain and france . in fact , their trading partners , the huron , welcomed la salle and the griffon in 1679 after he sailed into lake huron . the ontario heritage trust erected a sign under the blue water bridge in commemoration of the voyage , as shown by the photo of the sign . \\n  because of this beginning of the incursion of europeans into the area , the members of the confederacy helped shape the development of north america throughout the 18th century , becoming a center of trade and culture . great britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area as a set of allies against the french and the iroqouis . the people of the three fires confederacy , however , sided with the french during the seven years \\' war and only made peace with great britain after the treaty of fort niagara in 1764 . it also fought on the side of the british during the war of 1812 . the three fires confederacy also broke several treaties with the united states prior to 1815 , but finally signed the treaty of springwells in september of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the united states . the grand council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century , when more modern political systems began to evolve . \\n  after the war of 1812 , the first europeans in the area were french settlers loyal to the british crown who moved north from detroit . they successfully traded with the three fires confederacy , which contributed to the growth of the area . after its foundation , port sarnia expanded throughout the 19th century ; on 19 june 1856 , the residents passed the act to incorporate the town of sarnia and the name port sarnia was officially changed to sarnia effective 1 january 1857 . the act mentioned 1 @,@ 000 inhabitants in three wards . the wealth of adjoining stands of timber , the discovery of oil in nearby oil springs in 1858 by james miller williams , and the arrival of the great western railway in 1858 and the grand trunk railway in 1859 all stimulated sarnia \\'s growth . the rail lines were later linked directly to the united states by the opening of the st. clair tunnel under the st. clair river at sarnia in 1890 , by the grand trunk railway , which was the first railroad tunnel ever constructed under a river . the tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day , achieved through the development of original techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment . \\n  canada steamship lines formed in 1913 from many previous companies that plied the waters of the st. clair river . one of these companies was northwest transportation company of sarnia , which was founded in 1870 . by 20 april 1914 , when the residents passed act to incorporate the city of sarnia , the population had grown to 10 @,@ 985 in six wards . sarnia officially became a city as of 7 may 1914 . \\n  sarnia \\'s grain elevator , which is the sixth largest currently operating in canada , was built after the dredging of sarnia harbour in 1927 . two short years later , grain shipments had become an important part of sarnia \\'s economy . the grain elevator rises above the harbour , and next to it is the slip for the numerous bulk carriers and other ships that are part of the shipping industry that includes vessels from all over the world . the waterway between detroit and sarnia is one of the world \\'s busiest , as indicated by the average of 78 @,@ 943 @,@ 900 tonnes ( 87 @,@ 020 @,@ 800 short tons ; 77 @,@ 697 @,@ 100 long tons ) of shipping that annually travelled the river going in both directions during the period 1993 – 2002 . lake freighters and oceangoing ships , which are known as \" salties , \" pass up and down the river at the rate of about one every seven minutes during the shipping season . during this same period , the paul m. tellier tunnel , which was named after the retired president of cn in 2004 , was bored and began operation in 1995 . it accommodates double @-@ stacked rail cars and is located next to the original tunnel , which has been sealed . \\n  while there had been a petroleum industry in the sarnia area since 1858 , the establishment of polymer corporation in 1942 to manufacture synthetic rubber during world war ii was a great success and began sarnia \\'s rise as a major petrochemical centre . because of sarnia \\'s importance in this industry , it appeared on a united states government list of possible soviet targets as part of its anti @-@ energy nuclear strike strategy during the cold war . \\n  on 1 january 1991 , sarnia and the neighbouring town of clearwater were amalgamated as the new city of sarnia @-@ clearwater . the amalgamation was originally slated to include the village of point edward , although that village \\'s residents resisted and were eventually permitted to remain independent of the city . on 1 january 1992 , the city reverted to the name sarnia . \\n  sarnia \\'s population experienced a continual growth from 1961 to 1991 , with a 1991 population of 74 @,@ 376 . in 2001 the population had declined by approximately 3 @,@ 000 . since 2001 sarnia \\'s population has been growing slowly , with a 2011 population count of 72 @,@ 366 . despite these modest gains , an april 2010 report \" sarnia @-@ lambton \\'s labour market \" states : \" large petrochemical companies are the community \\'s main economic drivers . over the recent past , several plants have shutdown , and of those still in operation , increased automation and outsourcing has led to significantly fewer workers . \" . these shutdowns and the resulting loss of jobs , and therefore population as workers search for employment elsewhere , will contribute to a general decline

into the st. clair river . most of the surrounding area is flat , and the elevation ranges from 169 metres ( 554 ft ) and 281 metres ( 922 ft ) above sea level . the soil mostly comprises clay . despite this high percentage of clay , the soil is remarkably rich for cultivation . prior to the ice age , glaciers covered most of the area , as can be seen not only by the existence of the great lakes themselves but also of alluvial sand deposits , terminal moraines , and rich oil reserves . the entire area was submerged and plant and animal matter formed many layers of sediment as they settled after the waters receded . sarnia is not part of the canadian shield and is located just beyond its southernmost reaches , 290 kilometres ( 180 mi ) west of toronto and 106 kilometres ( 66 mi

is a graduate of binghamton university and received his ph.d in political science at princeton university . he has held faculty positions at brooklyn college , rutgers university , hunter college , new york university , and depaul university where he was an assistant professor from 2001 to 2007 . \\n  in 2007 , after a highly publicized feud between finkelstein and an academic opponent , alan

resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms . an official statement from depaul strongly defended the decision to deny finkelstein tenure , stated that outside influence played no role in the decision . in 2008 , he was banned from entering israel for 10 years . \\n  finkelstein taught at sakarya university middle east institute in turkey between 2014 and 2015 . \\n  = = personal background and education = = \\n  finkelstein has written of his jewish parents \\' experiences during world war ii . his mother , maryla husyt , grew up in warsaw , survived the warsaw ghetto , the majdanek concentration camp , and two slave labor camps . her first husband died in the war . she considered the day of her liberation as the most horrible day of her life , as she realized that she was alone , her parents and siblings gone . norman \\'s father , zacharias finkelstein , active in hashomer hatzair , was a survivor of both the warsaw ghetto and the auschwitz concentration camp . \\n  after the war they met in a displaced persons camp in linz , austria , and then emigrated to the united states , where his father became a factory worker and his mother a homemaker and later a bookkeeper . finkelstein \\'s mother was an ardent pacifist . both his parents died in 1995 . of his parents , finkelstein has recalled that \" they saw the world through the prism of the nazi holocaust . they were eternally indebted to the soviet union ( to whom they attributed the defeat of the nazis ) , and so anyone who was anti @-@ soviet they were extremely harsh on \" . they supported the soviet union \\'s approval of the creation of the state of israel , as enunciated by gromyko , who stated that the jews had earned the right to a state , but thought that israel had sold its soul to the west and \" refused to have any truck with it \" . \\n  finkelstein grew up in borough park , then mill basin , both in brooklyn , new york , where he attended james madison high school . in his memoir , finkelstein recalls his strong youthful identification with the outrage that his mother , witness to the genocidal atrocities of world war ii , felt at the carnage wrought by the united states in vietnam . one childhood friend recalls his mother \\'s \" emotional investment in left @-@ wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria \" . he had \" internalized [ her ] indignation \" , a trait which he admits rendered him \" insufferable \" when talking of the vietnam war , and which imbued him with a \" holier @-@ than @-@ thou \" attitude at the time which he now regrets . but finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother \\'s outlook — the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage in order to get on with one \\'s life — as a virtue . subsequently , his reading of noam chomsky played an important role in tailoring the passion bequeathed to him by his mother to the necessity of maintaining intellectual rigor . \\n  finkelstein completed his undergraduate studies at binghamton university in new york in 1974 , after which he studied at the école pratique des hautes études in paris . a deep admirer of paul sweezy , he was an ardent maoist and was devastated by the news of the trial of the gang of four , an event which \" totally devastated \" him , and led him to abandon marxism – leninism . \\n  finkelstein received his master \\'s degree in political science in 1980 , and later his phd in political studies , from princeton . his doctoral thesis was on zionism . before gaining academic employment , finkelstein was a part @-@ time social worker with teenage dropouts in new york . he then taught successively at rutgers university , new york university , brooklyn college , and hunter college and at depaul university in chicago . during the first intifada , he spent every summer from 1988 in the west bank , a guest of palestinian families in hebron and beit sahour . \\n  according to the new york times , finkelstein left hunter college in 2001 , \" after his teaching load and salary were reduced \" by the college administration . in his own recollection , he enjoyed teaching at hunter ( 1992 – 2000 ) and was \\' unceremoniously kicked out of \\' the school after begging them to keep him on with just two courses a semester ( $ 12 @,@ 000 a year ) . hunter set conditions that would have required him to spend four days a week , which he thought unacceptable . \\n  beginning with his doctoral thesis at princeton , finkelstein \\'s career has been marked by controversy . a self @-@ described \" forensic scholar \" , he has written sharply critical academic reviews of several prominent writers and scholars whom he accuses of misrepresenting the documentary record in order to defend israel \\'s policies and practices . his writings have dealt with politically charged topics such as zionism , the demographic history of palestine and his allegations of the existence of a \" holocaust industry \" that exploits the memory of the holocaust to further israeli and financial interests . \\n  citing linguist and political activist noam chomsky as an example , finkelstein notes that it is \" possible to unite exacting scholarly rigor with scathing moral outrage , \" and supporters and detractors alike have remarked on the polemical style of finkelstein \\'s work . its content has been praised by eminent historians such as raul hilberg and avi shlaim , as well as chomsky . \\n  finkelstein has described himself as \" an old @-@ fashioned communist , \" in the sense that he \" see [ s ] no value whatsoever in states . \" \\n  = = academic career = = \\n  = = = on from time immemorial = = = \\n  in finkelstein \\'s doctoral thesis , he examined the claims made in joan peters \\'s from time immemorial , a best @-@ selling book at the time . peters \\'s \" history and defense \" of israel deals with the demographic history of palestine . demographic studies had tended to assert that the arab population of ottoman @-@ controlled palestine , a 94 % majority at the turn of the century , had dwindled towards parity due to massive zionist immigration . peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other arab countries from the early 19th century onwards . it followed , for peters and many of her readers , that the picture of a native palestinian population overwhelmed by jewish immigration was little more than propaganda , and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land . \\n  from time immemorial had been praised by figures as varied as barbara tuchman , theodore h. white , elie wiesel , and lucy dawidowicz . saul bellow , for one , wrote in a jacket endorsement that : \\n  \" millions of people the world over , smothered by false history and propaganda , will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the palestinians . \" \\n  finkelstein asserted that the book was a \" monumental hoax \" . he later opined that , while peters \\'s book received widespread interest and approval in the united states , a scholarly demonstration of its fraudulence and unreliability aroused little attention : \\n  \" by the end of 1984 , from time immemorial had ... received some two hundred [ favorable ] notices ... in the united states . the only \\' false \\' notes in this crescendoing chorus of praise were the journal of palestine studies , which ran a highly critical review by bill farrell ; the small chicago @-@ based newsweekly in these times , which published a condensed version of this writer \\'s findings ; and alexander cockburn , who devoted a series of columns in the nation exposing the hoax . ... the periodicals in which from time immemorial had already been favorably reviewed refused to run any critical correspondence ( e.g. the new republic , the atlantic monthly , commentary ) . periodicals that had yet to review the book rejected a manuscript on the subject as of little or no consequence ( e.g. the village voice , dissent , the new york review of books ) . not a single national newspaper or columnist contacted found newsworthy that a best @-@ selling , effusively praised \\' study \\' of the middle east conflict was a threadbare hoax . \" \\n  noam chomsky later reminisced : \\n  \" i warned him , if you follow this , you \\'re going to get in trouble — because you \\'re going to expose the american intellectual community as a gang of frauds , and they are not going to like it , and they \\'re going to destroy you . \" \\n  in 1986 , the new york review of books published yehoshua porath \\'s review and an exchange with critics of the review in which he criticized the assumptions and evidence on which peters \\'s thesis relied , thus lending independent support from an expert in palestinian demographics to finkelstein \\'s doctoral critique . \\n  in the house journal of the american council on foreign relations , foreign affairs , william b. quandt , the edward stettinius professor of politics at the university of virginia and authority on middle eastern politics , later described finkelstein \\'s critique of from time immemorial as a \" landmark essay \" and a \" victory to his credit \" , in its \" demonstration \" of the \" shoddy scholarship \" of peters \\' book . israeli historian avi shlaim later praised finkelstein \\'s thesis , saying that it had established his credentials when he was still a doctoral student . in shlaim \\'s view , finkelstein had produced an \" unanswerable case \" with \" irrefutable evidence \" , proving that peters \\' book was both \" preposterous and worthless \" . \\n  according to noam chomsky , the controversy that surrounded finkelstein \\'s research caused a delay in his earning his ph.d. at princeton university . chomsky wrote in understanding power that finkelstein \" literally could not get the faculty to read [ his dissertation ] \" and that princeton eventually granted finkelstein his doctorate only \" out of embarrassment [ for princeton ] \" but refused to give him any further professional backing . \\n  finkelstein published portions of his thesis in the following publications : \\n  \" disinformation and the palestine question : the not @-@ so @-@ strange case of joan peters \\'s from time immemorial \" , chapter 2 of blaming the victims : spurious scholarship and the palestinian question ( 1988 ) ; and \\n  \" a land without a people ( joan peters \\' \" wilderness \" image ) \" , chapter 2 of image and reality of the israel @-@ palestine conflict ( 1995 ) . \\n  = = = the holocaust industry = = = \\n  the holocaust industry : reflections on the exploitation of jewish suffering was published in 2000 . here , finkelstein argues that elie wiesel and others exploit the memory of the holocaust as an \" ideological weapon . \" the purpose , writes finkelstein , is to enable the state of israel , \" one of the world \\'s most formidable military powers , with a horrendous human rights record , [ to ] cast itself as a victim state ; \" that is , to provide israel \" immunity to criticism . \" he alleges what he calls a \" double shakedown \" by \" a repellent gang of plutocrats , hoodlums and hucksters \" seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from germany and switzerland , moneys which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them , rather than actual holocaust survivors . \\n  the book received a hostile reception in some quarters , with critics charging that it was poorly researched and / or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes . the german historian hans mommsen disparaged the first edition as \" a most trivial book , which appeals to easily aroused anti @-@ semitic prejudices \" . israeli holocaust historian israel gutman called the book \" a lampoon \" , stating \" this is not research ; it isn \\'t even political literature ... i don \\'t even think it should be reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book . \" the book was also harshly criticized by brown university professor omer bartov and university of chicago professor peter novick . \\n  however , preeminent holocaust scholar raul hilberg said the book expressed views hilberg himself subscribed to in substance , in that he too found the exploitation of the holocaust , as finkelstein describes , \" detestable \" . asked on another occasion if finkelstein \\'s analysis might play into the hands of neo @-@ nazis for antisemitic purposes , hilberg replied : \" well , even if they do use it in that fashion , i \\'m afraid that when it comes to the truth , it has to be said openly , without regard to any consequences that would be undesirable , embarrassing \" . \\n  other critics claim finkelstein \\'s evidence is highly selective and / or dubious and that his arguments would be based on a misinterpretation of history and a questionable use of sources . the historian david cesarani wrote that while finkelstein absolves swiss banks of serious misconduct towards holocaust survivors and depicts them as victims of a jewish terror based on a sentence from an important report annex , he had ignored the report body which describes deceitful actions by swiss banks , inappropriate closing of accounts , failure to keep adequate records , and so on . \\n  = = = criticism of alan dershowitz \\'s the case for israel = = = \\n  shortly after the publication of the book the case for israel by alan dershowitz , finkelstein derided it as \" a collection of fraud , falsification , plagiarism , and nonsense \" . during a debate on democracy now ! , finkelstein asserted that dershowitz lacked knowledge about specific contents of his own book . he also claimed that dershowitz did not write the book , and may not have even read it . \\n  finkelstein noted 20 instances , in as many pages , where dershowitz \\'s book cites the same sources and passages used by joan peters in her book , in largely the same sequence , with ellipses in the same places . in two instances , dershowitz reproduces peters \\'s errors ( see below ) . from this finkelstein concluded that dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself , contrary to the latter \\'s claims . finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas . examining a copy of a proof of dershowitz \\'s book he managed to obtain , he found evidence that dershowitz had his secretarial assistant , holly beth billington , check in the harvard library the sources he had read in peters \\'s book . dershowitz answered the charge in a letter to the university of california \\'s press director lynne withey , arguing that finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation , in that he had changed its wording ( from \\' cite \\' to \\' copy \\' ) in his book . in public debate he has stated that if \" somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether mark twain had said that , obviously that would be a serious charge \" ; however , he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that , that he had indeed checked the original source by twain . \\n  dershowitz threatened libel action over the charges in finkelstein \\'s book , as a consequence of which , the publisher deleted the word \" plagiarism \" from the text before publication . finkelstein agreed to remove the suggestion that dershowitz was not the true author of the case for israel because , as the publisher said , \" he couldn \\'t document that \" . \\n  asserting that he did consult the original sources , dershowitz said finkelstein is simply accusing him of good scholarly practice : citing references he learned of initially from peters \\'s book . dershowitz denies that he used any of peters \\'s ideas without citation . \" plagiarism is taking someone else \\'s words and claiming they \\'re your own . there are no borrowed words from anybody . there are no borrowed ideas from anybody because i fundamentally disagree with the conclusions of peters \\'s book . \" in a footnote in the case for israel which cites peters \\'s book , dershowitz explicitly denies that he \" relies \" on peters for \" conclusions or data \" . \\n  in their joint interview on democracy now , however , finkelstein cited specific passages in dershowitz \\'s book in which a phrase that he says peters coined was incorrectly attributed to george orwell : \\n  \" [ peters ] coins the phrase , \\' turnspeak \\' , she says she \\'s using it as a play off of george orwell which as all listeners know used the phrase \\' newspeak . \\' she coined her own phrase , \\' turnspeak \\' . you go to mr. dershowitz \\'s book , he got so confused in his massive borrowings from joan peters that on two occasions , i \\'ll cite them for those who have a copy of the book , on page 57 and on page 153 he uses the phrase , quote , george orwell \\'s \\' turnspeak \\' . \\' turnspeak \\' is not orwell , mr. dershowitz , you \\'re the felix frankfurter chair at harvard , you must know that orwell would never use such a clunky phrase as \\' turnspeak \\' \" . \\n  james o. freedman , the former president of dartmouth college , the university of iowa , and the american academy of arts and sciences , has defended dershowitz : \\n  i do not understand [ finkelstein \\'s ] charge of plagiarism against alan dershowitz . there is no claim that dershowitz used the words of others without attribution . when he uses the words of others , he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources ( mark twain , palestine royal commission , etc . ) [ finkelstein \\'s ] complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source , in which dershowitz may have come upon them . but as the chicago manual of style emphasizes : \\' importance of attribution . with all reuse of others \\' materials , it is important to identify the original as the source . this not only bolsters the claims of fair use , it also helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism . \\' this is precisely what dershowitz did . \\n  responding to an article in the nation by alexander cockburn , dershowitz also cited the chicago manual of style : \\n  cockburn \\'s claim is that some of the quotes should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source , where he believes i stumbled upon them . even if he were correct that i found all these quotations in peters \\'s book , the preferred method of citation is to the original source , as the chicago manual of style emphasizes : \" with all reuse of others \\' materials , it is important to identify the original as the source . this ... helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... to cite a source from a secondary source ( \\' quoted in ... \\' ) is generally to be discouraged .... \" \\n  ... to which cockburn responded : \\n  quoting the chicago manual of style , dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing \" the original \" as opposed to the secondary source , peters . he misrepresents chicago here , where \" the original \" means merely the origin of the borrowed material , which is , in this instance , peters . \\n  now look at the second bit of the quote from chicago , chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three @-@ point ellipsis . as my associate kate levin has discovered , this passage ( \" to cite a source from a secondary source ... \" ) occurs on page 727 , which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis , in a section titled \" citations taken from secondary sources . \" here \\'s the full quote , with what dershowitz left out set in bold : \" \\' quoted in \\' . to cite a source from a secondary source ( \" quoted in \" ) is generally to be discouraged , since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite . if an original source is unavailable , however , both the original and the secondary source must be listed . \" \\n  so chicago is clearly insisting that unless dershowitz went to the originals , he was obliged to cite peters . finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn \\'t go to the originals . plagiarism , qed , plus added time for willful distortion of the language of chicago \\'s guidelines , cobbling together two separate discussions . \\n  on behalf of dershowitz , harvard law school dean elena kagan asked former harvard president derek bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism ; bok exonerated dershowitz of the charge . \\n  in an april 3 , 2007 interview with the harvard crimson , \" dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last september to depaul faculty members lobbying against finkelstein \\'s tenure . \" \\n  in april 2007 , dr. frank menetrez , a former editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the ucla law review , published an analysis of the charges made against finkelstein by dershowitz , finding no merit in any single charge and concluding that dershowitz had misrepresented matters . in a follow @-@ up analysis he concluded that he could find \\' no way of avoiding the inference that dershowitz copied the quotation from twain from peters \\'s from time immemorial , and not from the original source \\' , as dershowitz claimed . in an interview given for the film american radical : the trials of norman finkelstein in 2009 , dershowitz said of finkelstein : \" i don \\'t think he is a jew . he \\'s jewish only on his parents \\' side . \" \\n  = = controversies = = \\n  = = = tenure denial and resignation = = = \\n  in september 2006 , dershowitz sent members of depaul \\'s law and political science faculties what he described as \" a dossier of norman finkelstein \\'s most egregious academic sins , and especially his outright lies , misquotations , and distortions \" and lobbied professors , alumni and administrators to deny finkelstein tenure . de paul \\'s political science committee investigated his accusations against finkelstein and concluded that they were not based on legitimate criticism . the department subsequently invited john mearsheimer and ian lustick , two independent academics with known expertise on the israel – palestine conflict , to evaluate the academic merit of finkelstein \\'s work ; they came to the same conclusion . \\n  also in 2006 , the washington post noted \" the adl repeatedly accused \" norman finkelstein of being a \" holocaust denier \" and that \" these charges have proved baseless . \" finkelstein \\'s mother survived the majdanek concentration camp , his father survived the auschwitz concentration camp , and most of his family died in the holocaust \\n  in early 2007 , the depaul political science department voted nine to three , and the college of liberal arts and sciences personnel committee five to zero , in favor of giving finkelstein tenure . the three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure , supported by the dean of the college , chuck suchar . suchar stated he opposed tenure because finkelstein \\'s \" personal and reputation demeaning attacks on dershowitz , benny morris , and the holocaust authors elie wiesel and jerzy kosinski \" were inconsistent with depaul \\'s \" vincentian \" values ; as examples of the latter , suchar argued that finkelstein lacked respect for \" the dignity of the individual \" and for \" the rights of others to hold and express different intellectual positions \" . amidst considerable public debate , dershowitz actively campaigned to block finkelstein \\'s tenure bid . in june 2007 , a 4 – 3 vote by depaul university \\'s board on promotion and tenure ( a faculty board ) , affirmed by the university \\'s president , the rev. dennis holtschneider , denied finkelstein tenure . \\n  the university denied that dershowitz , who had been criticized for his campaign against finkelstein \\'s tenure , played any part in this decision . at the same time , the university denied tenure to international studies assistant professor mehrene larudee , a strong supporter of finkelstein , despite unanimous support from her department , the personnel committee and the dean . finkelstein stated that he would engage in civil disobedience if attempts were made to bar him from teaching his students . \\n  the faculty council later affirmed the right of professors finkelstein and larudee to appeal , which a university lawyer said was not possible . council president anne bartlett said she was \" \\' terribly concerned \\' correct procedure was not followed \" . depaul \\'s faculty association considered taking no @-@ confidence votes on administrators , including the president , because of the tenure denials . in a statement issued upon finkelstein \\'s resignation , depaul called him \" a prolific scholar and an outstanding teacher \" . dershowitz expressed outrage at the compromise and this statement in particular , saying that the university had \" traded truth for peace \" . \\n  in june 2007 , after two weeks of protests , some depaul students staged a sit @-@ in and hunger strike in support of both professors denied tenure . the illinois conference of the american association of university professors also sent a letter to the university \\'s president stating : \" it is entirely illegitimate for a university to deny tenure to a professor out of fear that his published research ... might hurt a college \\'s reputation \" and that the association has \" explicitly rejected collegiality as an appropriate criterion for evaluating faculty members \" . in a 2014 interview , professor matthew abraham , author of out of bounds : academic freedom and the question of palestine , described the finkelstein tenure case as \" one of the most significant academic freedom cases in the last fifty years \" , claiming the case demonstrated \" the substantial pressure outside parties can place on a mid @-@ tier religious institution when the perspectives advanced by a controversial scholar threaten dominant interests \" . \\n  = = = denied entry to israel in 2008 = = = \\n  on may 23 , 2008 , finkelstein was denied entry to israel , according to unnamed shin bet security officials , because \" of suspicions involving hostile elements in lebanon \" and that he \" did not give a full accounting to interrogators with regard to these suspicions . \" finkelstein had previously visited south lebanon and met with lebanese families during the 2006 lebanon war . he was banned from entering israel for 10 years . \\n  finkelstein was questioned after his arrival at ben gurion airport near tel aviv and detained for 24 hours in a holding cell . after speaking to israeli attorney michael sfard he was placed on a flight back to amsterdam , his point of origin . in an interview with haaretz , finkelstein stated \" i did my best to provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me . i am confident that i have nothing to hide ... no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations . \" he had been travelling to visit friends in the west bank and stated he had no interest in visiting israel . sfard said banning finkelstein from entering the country \" recalls the behavior of the soviet bloc countries \" . \\n  = = reception = = \\n  finkelstein \\'s books are an attempt to examine the works of mainstream scholarship . the authors whose work he has thus targeted , including daniel jonah goldhagen and dershowitz , along with others such as benny morris whose work finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship , have in turn accused finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting their work , and selectively quoting from their books . \\n  according to raul hilberg , finkelstein displays \" academic courage to speak the truth when no one else is out there to support him ... i would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured , and that those who in the end are proven right triumph , and he will be among those who will have triumphed , albeit , it so seems , at great cost . \" in a peer review for beyond chutzpah , avi shlaim said that finkelstein \" has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious american @-@ jewish scholarship on the arab @-@ israeli conflict . \" he praised finkelstein for \" all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous : erudition , originality , spark , meticulous attention to detail , intellectual integrity , courage , and formidable forensic skills . \" \\n  sara roy stated that her shared experience with finkelstein as a child of holocaust survivors engaged in research on the palestinian @-@ israeli conflict gave her a unique position to comment . according to roy , finkelstein \\'s scholarship is , \" exceptional both for its brilliance and rigor . in the fields of middle eastern studies and political science his work is considered seminal and there is no doubt that both disciplines would be intellectually weaker without it . norman \\'s power and value , however , do not emanate only from his scholarship but from his character . his life ’ s work , shaped largely but not entirely by his experience as a child of survivors has been and continues to be informed by a profound concern with human dignity and the danger of dehumanization . \" \\n  the israeli newspaper , haaretz , stated that \" [ i ] t is difficult to sympathize with finkelstein \\'s opinions and preferences , especially since he decided to support hezbollah , meet with its fighters and visit the graves of some of its slain operatives . \" still , it continued to say that he should not be banned from entering israel , because \" meetings with hezbollah operatives do not in themselves constitute a security risk \" . \\n  = = = 2009 film about finkelstein = = = \\n  american radical : the trials of norman finkelstein is an award @-@ winning documentary film about the life and career of norman finkelstein , released in 2009 and directed by david ridgen and nicolas rossier . it has been screened in amsterdam idfa , in toronto hot docs and in more than 40 other national and international venues , it received a freshness rating of 100 % on film review aggregator rotten tomatoes . the same year finkelstein appeared in defamation ( hebrew : השמצה ; translit . hashmatsa ) a documentary film by award @-@ winning israeli filmmaker yoav shamir . \\n  = = = criticism = = = \\n  criticism has been leveled against finkelstein from several angles . the first sources are responses from those whose work finkelstein has discussed . daniel goldhagen , whose book hitler \\'s willing executioners finkelstein criticized , claimed his scholarship has \" everything to do with his burning political agenda \" . alan dershowitz has written that peter novick , professor of history at the university of chicago and a noted holocaust historian whose work finkelstein says inspired the holocaust industry , has strongly criticized the latter \\'s work , describing it as \" trash \" . similarly , dershowitz , whose book the case for israel and finkelstein \\'s response beyond chutzpah sparked an ongoing feud between the two , has claimed finkelstein \\'s complicity in a conspiracy against pro @-@ israel scholars : \" the mode of attack is consistent . chomsky selects the target and directs finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn \\'t actually write the work , that it is plagiarized , that it is a hoax and a fraud , \" arguing that finkelstein has leveled charges against many academics , calling at least 10 \" distinguished jews \\' hucksters \\' , \\' hoaxters \\' ( sic ) , \\' thieves \\' , \\' extortionists \\' , and worse . \" although the back and forth between finkelstein and dershowitz received the most attention and attracted significant controversy , finkelstein has maintained that \" the real issue is israel \\'s human rights record . \" \\n  israeli historian omer bartov , writing for the new york times book review , judged the holocaust industry to be marred by the same errors he denounces in those who exploit the holocaust for profit or politics : \\n  it is filled with precisely the kind of shrill hyperbole that finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the holocaust ; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts , inner contradictions , strident politics and dubious contextualizations ; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority ... like any conspiracy theory , it contains several grains of truth ; and like any such theory , it is both irrational and insidious . \\n  finkelstein has accused journalist jeffrey goldberg of \" torturing \" or \" being an accessory to torture of \" palestinian prisoners during his idf service in the first intifada , based on statements made in goldberg \\'s book prisoners . finkelstein says that goldberg admits to personally sending prisoners to the zinzana , which he says has been repeatedly condemned as torture in human rights reports . goldberg referred to the allegation as \" ridiculous \" and he had \" never laid a hand on anybody . \" goldberg said his \" principal role \" was \" making sure prisoners had fresh fruit . \" he characterized finkelstein as a \" ridiculous figure \" and accused him of \" lying and purposely misreading my book . \" \\n  = = statements on israel = = \\n  finkelstein is a sharp critic of the state of israel . discussing finkelstein \\'s book beyond chutzpah , israeli historian avi shlaim stated that finkelstein \\'s critique of israel \" is based on an amazing amount of research . he seems to have read everything . he has gone through the reports of israeli groups , of human rights groups , human rights watch and peace now and b \\'tselem , all of the reports of amnesty international . and he deploys all this evidence from israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of israeli practices , israeli violations of human rights of the palestinians , israeli house demolitions , the targeted assassinations of palestinian militants , the cutting down of trees , the building of the wall — the security barrier on the west bank , which is illegal — the restrictions imposed on the palestinians in the west bank , and so on and so forth . i find his critique extremely detailed , well @-@ documented and accurate . \" \\n  in a telephone interview with today \\'s zaman , in 2009 , finkelstein stated : \\n  i think israel , as a number of commentators pointed out , is becoming an insane state . and we have to be honest about that . while the rest of the world wants peace , europe wants peace , the us wants peace , but this state wants war , war and war . in the first week of the massacres , there were reports in the israeli press that israel did not want to put all its ground forces in gaza because it was preparing attacks on iran . then there were reports it was planning attacks on lebanon . it is a lunatic state . \\n  when asked how he , as the son of holocaust survivors , felt about israel ’ s operation in gaza , finkelstein replied : \\n  it has been a long time since i felt any emotional connection with the state of israel , which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious , murderous wars . it is a vandal state . there is a russian writer who once described vandal states as genghis khan with a telegraph . israel is genghis khan with a computer . i feel no emotion of affinity with that state . i have some good friends and their families there , and of course i would not want any of them to be hurt . that said , sometimes i feel that israel has come out of the boils ( sic ) of the hell , a satanic state . \\n  the anti @-@ defamation league has described finkelstein as an \" obsessive anti @-@ zionist \" filled with \" vitriolic hatred of zionism and israel . \" on being called an anti @-@ zionist finkelstein has said : \" it \\'s a superficial term . i am opposed to any state with an ethnic character , not only to israel . \" \\n  finkelstein is an advocate of a two @-@ state solution to the israeli @-@ palestinian conflict . \\n  = = = hezbollah and hamas = = = \\n  finkelstein has expressed solidarity with hezbollah and hamas with respect to defensive actions , alleging that israel had invaded lebanon as a signal of rejection when hamas was seeking a diplomatic settlement with israel . he also condemned what he said was israel \\'s refusal \" to abide by international law [ and ] to abide by the opinion of the international community \" to settle the conflict . \\n  \" i was of course happy to meet the hizbullah people , because it is a point of view that is rarely heard in the united states . i have no problem saying that i do want to express solidarity with them , and i am not going to be a coward of ( sic ) a hypocrite about it . i don \\'t care about hizbullah as a political organization . i don \\'t know much about their politics , and anyhow , it \\'s irrelevant . i don \\'t live in lebanon . it \\'s a choice that the lebanese have to make : who they want to be their leaders , who they want to represent them . but there is a fundamental principle . people have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers , and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country . that to me is a very basic , elementary and uncomplicated question . \" \\n  while condemning the targeting of civilians to achieve a political goal , finkelstein has stated he believes hezbollah has the right to target israeli civilians as long as \" israel persists in targeting [ lebanese ] civilians until israel ceases its terrorist acts . \" \\n  finkelstein claims that an equivalence exists between hamas and the state of israel in regards to the military policy of targeted killings during the second intifada . according to finkelstein \" the record shows that israel has routinely targeted civilians for killing \" and \" israel indiscriminately kills civilians \" . he concludes that \" the argument , among human rights organizations at any rate is that ... in effect , there ’ s no difference between indiscriminately killing civilians and targeting civilians . \" \\n  finkelstein argued one of israel \\'s primary motivations for launching the 2008 offensive in gaza was that hamas was \" signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the june 1967 border . \" finkelstein believes hamas had joined the international community in \" seeking a diplomatic settlement \" and describes hamas \\'s stance towards israel prior to the war as a \" peace offensive . \" \\n  = = statements on the bds movement = = \\n  finkelstein had made many criticisms of the boycott ,

making the same point about tactics and goals . \\n  in february 2012 , the jewish chronicle in england stated that finkelstein \" launched a blistering attack \" on the bds movement , saying it was a \" hypocritical , dishonest cult \" , \" [ l ] ike the munchkin cult in oz , \" that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel . finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes , and that just like a cult , the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views . \\n  in june 2012 , in an appearance on democracy now ! , finkelstein elaborated on his criticisms of the bds movement : \\n  the problem as i see it with the bds movement is not the tactic . who could not support boycott , divestment and sanctions ? of course you should . and most of the human rights organizations , church organizations have moved in that direction . the problem is the goal . . . the official bds movement , they claim to be agnostic , neutral — whatever term you want to use — on the question of israel . you can ’ t reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of israel . the broad public wants to know , where do you stand ? and if you claim not to have a stand , you lose them . the bds movement , it always says , and i ’ m using their language , \" we are a rights @-@ based organization . we are based in international law . \" i agree with that . that ’ s where you have to go : rights @-@ based international law . but the international law is clear . you read the last sentence of the 2004 international court of justice opinion on the wall that israel has been building in the west bank , and the last sentence says , \" we look forward to two states : a palestinian state alongside israel and at peace with its neighbors . \" that \\'s the law . \\n  and if you want to go past that law or ignore the israel part , you ’ ll never reach a broad public . and then it \\'s a cult . then it ’ s pointless , in my opinion . we \\'re wasting time . and it \\'s only a wasting of time . it becomes — and i know it \\'s a strong word , and i hope i won \\'t be faulted for it , but it becomes historically criminal , because there was a time where whatever we said , it made no difference . nobody was listening . you could shout whatever you want — who cares ? but now , actually , we can reach people . there is a possibility . i ’ m not saying a certainty . i \\'m not even saying a probability . but there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public . and so , we have to be very careful about the words we use , and we have to be very careful about the political strategy we map out . otherwise , we \\'re going to squander a real opportunity . and i don \\'t want to squander it . \\n  = = = books = = = \\n  2014 : method and madness : the hidden story of israel \\'s assaults on gaza , or books , new york ( 2014 ) \\n  2014 : old wine ,

stinkhorn , or the devil \\'s dipstick , is a species of fungus in the phallaceae family . a saprobic species , it is typically found growing on the ground singly or in small groups on woody debris or leaf litter , during summer and autumn in japan , europe , and eastern north america . the fruit body begins its development in an \" egg \" form , resembling somewhat a puffball partially submerged in the ground . as the fungus matures , a slender orange to pink colored stalk emerges that tapers evenly to a pointed tip . the stalk is covered with a foul @-@ smelling slimy green spore mass on the upper third of its length . flies and other insects feed upon the slime which contains the spores , assisting in their dispersal . due to their repellent odor , mature specimens are not generally considered edible , although there are reports of the immature \" eggs \" being consumed . in the laboratory , mutinus elegans has been shown to inhibit the growth of several microorganisms that can be pathogenic to humans . \\n  = = taxonomy = = \\n  mutinus elegans was first described by british missionary john banister in 1679 who chronicled the natural history of virginia ; this early report is thought to be the first account of a fungus in north america . it was first characterized scientifically by french scientist jean pierre françois camille montagne in 1856 , who called it corynites elegans . the genus name mutinus refers to a phallic deity , mutinus mutunus , one of the roman di indigetes placated by roman brides . the species is commonly known variously as the \" elegant stinkhorn \" , the \" headless stinkhorn \" , the \" dog stinkhorn \" , or the \" devil \\'s dipstick \" . the specific epithet elegans is derived from the latin word meaning \" graceful \" or \" elegant \" . \\n  = = description = = \\n  the young fruiting bodies are initially white and spherical or egg @-@ shaped , partially submerged in the ground , with dimensions of 2 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) by 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) . as the fruit body matures , the egg ruptures and the spongy spore @-@ bearing stalk emerges ; fully grown , it may be from 1 to 15 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) long and 1 @.@ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick . the stalk is hollow and strongly wrinkled overall ; its shape is cylindrical below , but it gradually tapers to a narrow apex with a small opening at the tip . the upper half of the stalk is bright red to reddish orange , and the color gradually loses intensity transforming into pinkish white below . the stalk may be straight , or slightly curved . a gelatinous greenish @-@ brown gleba covers the upper third of the stalk in newly emerged specimens . the remains of the \" egg \" forms a volva around the base of the stalk . the odor of the gleba is foul ; one author describes it as \" sickly sweet or metallic \" . the spores are a greenish @-@ brown color . fruit bodies are attached to the substrate by whitish rhizomorphs that resemble plant roots . american mycologist smith noted that the eggs are often slow to open , sometimes taking up to two weeks before the stalk expands . \\n  the spores are 4 – 7 by 2 – 3 µm , oblong @-@ elliptical , smooth , and embedded in the gleba . a 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the phallaceae family , including mutinus elegans , have a hilar scar ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 3 µm diameter ) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy . the hilar scar is a circular indentation at one end of the spore , and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium . \\n  = = = edibility = = = \\n  the immature egg @-@ forms of mutinus elegans are edible , but \" not recommended \" . one field guides notes that the eggs of the stinkhorn fungi \" taste like the seasonings that are added to them . \" the fetid odor of mature specimens would probably be repellent to most , although they are not considered poisonous . \\n  = = = similar species = = = \\n  the \" dog stinkhorn \" ( mutinus caninus ) is smaller , has a distinct oval or spindle @-@ shaped tip on a slender stem and lacks the bright coloring of m. elegans ; it has less of the stalk covered by gleba . the portion of the stalk below the spore mass is pitted in m. caninus , compared to \" pebbly \" in m. elegans . m. caninus is also less common than m. elegans . mutinus bambusinus is similar in size and shape , except it does not have a distinct color demarcation between the upper and lower parts of the stalk ; instead , the entire stem shows red pigments . the stalk of m. ravenelii is less tapered than m. elegans , and it has a clearly differentiated swollen head . \\n  = = habitat and distribution = = \\n  mutinus elegans is saprobic — deriving nutrients by breaking down dead or dying organic matter . it is commonly found in gardens and farm areas enriched with manure , near well @-@ decayed stumps and logs , and in wood chips . a japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in takatsuki and osaka @-@ fu , where it fruited in november and december on the ground along paths or in open spaces , under or near bamboo ( phyllostachys bambusoides ) and hardwoods such as the sawtooth oak , the japanese zelkova , and the camphor tree . \\n  this common species has been collected in eastern north america , in the area extending from quebec to florida and west to the great lakes , iowa , and texas . in europe , it has been reported from netherlands and in asia , it has been collected in japan . \\n  = =

\\n  = = background = = \\n  the boat race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the university of oxford ( sometimes referred to as the \" dark blues \" ) and the university of

thames in southwest london . the rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the united kingdom and worldwide . cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1899 race by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths , while oxford led overall with 32 victories to cambridge \\'s 23 ( excluding the \" dead heat \" of 1877 ) . leading up to the race , oxford suffered a variety of misfortune : m. c. mcthornhill was ordered by his doctor not to row , h. j. hale was injured and president felix warre contracted scarlet fever . \\n  cambridge were coached by james brookes close , who had rowed for the light blues three times between 1872 and 1874 , and stanley muttlebury , five @-@ time blue for cambridge between 1886 and 1890 . oxford \\'s coaches were harcourt gilbey gold ( dark blue president the previous year and four @-@ time blue ) and douglas mclean ( an oxford blue five times between 1883 and 1887 ) . the umpire for

experience : c. e. johnston , c. w. tomlkinson and cox g. s. maclagan . cambridge saw six of their 1899 crew return , including william dudley ward and raymond broadly etherington @-@ smith , both of whom were rowing in their third race . eight of the nine light blues were students at trinity college . oxford \\'s stroke h. h. dutton , a native of south australia , was the only non @-@ british participant registered in the race . author and former oxford rower george drinkwater suggested that this year \\'s cambridge crew , along with the oxford crew which rowed in the 1897 race , \" stand

to start from the surrey station , handing the middlesex side of the river to cambridge . in good conditions , umpire willan got the race under way at 2 : 00 p.m. whereupon cambridge took the lead immediately . by craven steps they were three lengths ahead and continued to draw away from the dark blues , to win by 20 lengths in a time of 18 minutes 45 seconds . it was the fastest winning time in the history of the event , equalling that set by oxford in the 1893 race . although it was the light blues \\' second consecutive victory , it followed a run of nine consecutive wins for oxford – overall the dark blues led 32 – 24 . \\n  = ten commandments in catholic theology = \\n  the ten commandments are a series of religious and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the abrahamic religions , including catholicism . as described in the old testament books exodus and deuteronomy , the commandments form part of a covenant offered by god to the israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin . according to the catechism of the catholic church — the official exposition of the catholic church \\'s christian beliefs — the commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth , and serve as the basis for catholic social justice . a review of the commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by catholics before receiving the sacrament of penance . \\n  the commandments appear in the earliest church writings ; the catechism states that they have \" occupied a predominant place \" in teaching the faith since the time of augustine of hippo ( ad 354 – 430 ) . the church had no official standards for religious instruction until the fourth lateran council in 1215 ; evidence suggests the commandments were used in christian education in the early church and throughout the middle ages , but with inconsistent emphasis . the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the church by protestant reformers . afterward , the first church @-@ wide catechism in 1566 provided \" thorough discussions of each commandment \" , but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments . the most recent catechism devotes a large section to interpret each of the commandments . \\n  church teaching of the commandments is largely based on the old and new testaments and the writings of the early church fathers . in the new testament , jesus acknowledged their validity and instructed his disciples to go further , demanding a righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and pharisees . summarized by jesus into two \" great commandments \" that teach love of god and love of neighbor , they instruct individuals on their relationships with both . the first three commandments demand respect for god \\'s name , observation of the lord \\'s day and prohibit the worship of other gods . the others deal with the relationships between individuals , such as that between parent and child ; they include prohibitions against lying , stealing , murdering , adultery and covetousness . \\n  = = numbering = = \\n  the old testament refers to ten individual commandments , even though there are more than ten imperative sentences in the two relevant texts : exodus 20 : 1 – 17 and deuteronomy 5 : 6 – 21 . the old testament does not make clear how the texts should be divided to arrive at ten commandments . the division traditionally used by the catholic and lutheran churches was first derived by the latin church father augustine of hippo ( 354 – 430 ) in his book questions on exodus . other christian churches , such as the eastern orthodox and some protestant churches , use a form established by the greek fathers . the two forms have slightly different numbering , but maintain exactly the same substance despite protestant accusations to the contrary . jewish numbering differs from christian denominations in that it considers what many christians call a prologue to be the entire first commandment . \\n  = = history = = \\n  the ten commandments are recognized as a moral foundation by judaism , christianity , and islam . they first appear in the book of exodus , according to which moses , acting under the orders of god , freed the israelites from physical slavery in egypt . according to church teaching , god offered a covenant — which included the ten commandments — to also free them from the \" spiritual slavery \" of sin . some historians have described this as \" the central event in the history of ancient israel \" . \\n  the coming of jesus is seen by the catholic church as the fulfillment of the destiny of the jews , who were chosen , according to peter kreeft , to \" show the true god to the world \" . jesus acknowledged the commandments and instructed his followers to go further , requiring , in kreeft \\'s words , \" more , not less : a \\' righteousness ( which ) exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees \\' \" . explaining church teaching , kreeft states , \" the commandments are to the moral order what the creation story in genesis 1 is to the natural order . they are god \\'s order conquering chaos . they are not man \\'s ideas about god , but god \\'s ideas about man . \" the church teaches that jesus freed people from keeping \" the burdensome jewish law ( torah or mosaic law ) with its 613 distinct regulations [ but ] not from the obligation to keep the ten commandments \" , because the ten \" were written \\' with the finger of god \\' , unlike [ those ] written by moses \" . this teaching was reaffirmed at the council of trent ( 1545 – 1563 ) and at the second vatican council ( 1962 – 1965 ) . \\n  although it is uncertain what role the ten commandments played in early christian worship , evidence suggests they were recited during some services and used in christian education . for example , the commandments are included in one of the earliest christian writings , known as the teaching of the twelve apostles or the didache . scholars contend that the commandments were highly regarded by the early church as a summary of god \\'s law . the protestant scholar klaus bockmuehl believes that the church replaced the commandments with lists of virtues and vices , such as the seven deadly sins , from 400 – 1200 . other scholars contend that throughout church history the commandments have been used as an examination of conscience and that many theologians have written about them . while evidence exists that the commandments were part of catechesis in monasteries and other venues , there was no official church position to promote specific methods of religious instruction during the middle ages . the fourth lateran council ( 1215 ) was the first attempt to remedy this problem . surviving evidence reveals that some bishops \\' efforts to implement the council \\'s resolutions included special emphasis on teaching the commandments in their respective dioceses . centuries later , the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the church by protestant reformers . \\n  catechisms produced in specific dioceses from the mid @-@ fourteenth century emphasized the commandments and laid the foundation for the first official church @-@ wide catechism , the 1566 roman catechism . commissioned by the council of trent , it provided \" thorough discussions of each commandment \" but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments to emphasize the catholic belief that christian life was dependent upon the grace solely obtained through the sacramental life provided by the catholic church . this emphasis conflicted with protestant beliefs , which held the commandments as the source of divine grace . while more recent papal encyclicals offer interpretations of church teaching on individual commandments , throughout history official church teachings on the commandments are based on their mentions in the old and new testaments and the writings of the early church fathers origen , irenaeus and augustine . later , theologians thomas aquinas and bonaventure offered notable commentaries on the commandments . aquinas , a doctor of the church , considered them to be the \" primary precepts of justice and all law , and natural reason gives immediate assent to them as being plainly evident principles . \" \\n  the most recent catechism of the catholic church — the official summary of church beliefs — devotes a large section to the commandments , which serve as the basis for catholic social teaching . according to the catechism , the church has given them a predominant place in teaching the faith since the fifth century . kreeft explains that the church regards them as \" a path of life \" , and a \" path to freedom \" just as a schoolyard fence protects children from \" life @-@ threatening dangers \" . \\n  = = first commandment = = \\n  the first commandment , according to church teaching , \" means that [ followers ] must worship and adore god alone because god is alone . \" the catechism explains that this prohibits idolatry , providing examples of forbidden practices such as the worship of any creature , and of \" \\' demons ... power , pleasure , race , ancestors , the state [ and ] money \\' \" . augustine interpreted this commandment as \" love god and then do what you will \" . explaining this sentiment , kreeft states that all sin \" serves some other god , obeys another commander : the world or the flesh or the devil \" , if god truly be loved then one will do what god wills . \\n  the catechism associates this commandment with the three theological virtues . the first virtue , faith , instructs catholics to believe in god and avoid heresy , apostasy , and schism . the second virtue , hope , cautions catholics against despair and presumption . according to the catechism , the last virtue , charity , can be met only if catholics refrain from indifference or ingratitude toward god , and avoid spiritual laziness and a hatred of god stemming from pride . the catechism enumerates specific violations of this commandment , including superstition , polytheism , sacrilege , atheism , and all practices of magic and sorcery . it further prohibits astrology , palm reading , and consulting horoscopes or mediums . the catechism attributes the latter actions to a \" desire for power over time , history , and in the last analysis , other human beings as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers \" . \\n  = = = graven images = = = \\n  while catholics are sometimes accused of worshiping images , in violation of the first commandment , the church says this is a misunderstanding . in the church \\'s opinion , \" the honor paid to sacred images is a \\' respectful veneration \\' , not the adoration due to god alone \" . in the 8th century , heated arguments arose over whether religious icons ( in this context paintings ) were prohibited by the first commandment . the dispute was almost entirely restricted to the eastern church ; the iconoclasts wished to prohibit icons , while the iconodules supported their veneration , a position consistently backed by the western church . at the second council of nicaea in 787 , the ecumenical council determined that the veneration of icons and statues was not in violation of the commandment and stated \" whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it . \" at around the time of the controversy over iconoclasm , the western church began to use monumental sculpture , which by the romanesque period became a major feature of western christian art , that has remained part of the catholic tradition , in contrast to eastern christianity , which avoids large religious sculpture . the catechism , using very traditional arguments , posits that god gave permission for images that symbolize christian salvation by leaving symbols such as the bronze serpent , and the cherubim on the ark of the covenant . it states that \" by becoming incarnate , the son of god introduced a new economy of images \" . \\n  the united states conference of catholic bishops ( usccb ) explain the catechism in their book entitled united states catechism for adults , published in 2006 . regarding graven images , they expound that this command addresses idolatry that in ancient times expressed itself in the worship of such things as the \" sun , moon , stars , trees , bulls , eagles , and serpents \" as well as \" emperors and kings \" . they explain that today , idolatry expresses itself in the worship of other things , and list some as \" power , money , materialism and sports . \" \\n  = = second commandment = = \\n  the second commandment prohibits the use of god \\'s name in vain . many ancient cultures believed that names were sacred ; some had prohibitions on when a person \\'s name could be spoken . the gospel of john relates an incident where a group of jews attempted to stone jesus after he used a sacred name of god to refer to himself . they interpreted his statement as a claim of divinity . since they did not believe that he was god , they considered this blasphemy , which under mosaic law carries a death penalty . kreeft writes that all of the names by which god is known are holy , and thus all of those names are protected by the second commandment . the catechism states , \" respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the mystery of god himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes . \" the catechism also requires respect for the names of people out of respect for the dignity of that person . \\n  the sentiment behind this commandment is further codified in the lord \\'s prayer , which begins , \" our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name \" . according to pope benedict xvi , when god revealed his name to moses he established a relationship with mankind ; benedict states that the incarnation was the culmination of a process that \" had begun with the giving of the divine name . \" benedict elaborates that this means the divine name could be misused and that jesus \\' inclusion of \" hallowed be thy name \" is a plea for the sanctification of god \\'s name , to \" protect the wonderful mystery of his accessibility to us , and constantly assert his true identity as opposed to our distortion of it \" . \\n  according to catholic teaching , this commandment does not preclude the use of god \\'s name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority . however , lying under oath , invoking god \\'s name for magical purposes , or voicing words of hatred or defiance against god are considered sins of blasphemy . \\n  = = third commandment = = \\n  quoting the jewish rabbi and scholar jacob neusner , pope benedict xvi explains that to israel , keeping this commandment was more than ritual ; it was a way to imitate god , who rested on the seventh day after the creation . it also constituted the core of the social order . \\n  although a few christian denominations follow the judaic practice of observing the sabbath on saturday , catholics , along with most christians , observe sunday as a special day , which they call the \" lord \\'s day \" . this practice dates to the first century , arising from their belief that jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week . the didache calls on christians to come together on the lord \\'s day to break bread and give thanks . tertullian is the first to mention sunday rest : \" we , however ( just as tradition has taught us ) , on the day of the lord \\'s resurrection ought to guard not only against kneeling , but every posture and office of solicitude , deferring even our businesses lest we give any place to the devil \" ( \" de orat . \" , xxiii ; cf . \" ad nation . \" , i , xiii ; \" apolog . \" , xvi ) . \\n  in the sixth century , caesarius of arles taught that the whole glory of the jewish sabbath had been transferred to sunday and that christians must keep sunday in the same way as the jews were commanded to keep the sabbath . the council of orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency , to apply the law of the jewish sabbath to the observance of the christian sunday , as jewish and non @-@ christian . \\n  the church leaders of later centuries inscribed sunday rest into official church teaching , and christian governments have attempted to enforce the sunday rest throughout history . for catholics , jesus \\' teaching that \" the sabbath was made for man , not man for the sabbath \" means that good works \" when the needs of others demand it \" can be part of the day of rest . the catechism offers guidelines on how to observe the lord \\'s day , which include attending mass on sundays and holy days of obligation . on these days , catholics may not work or do activities that \" hinder the worship due to god \" , but \" performance of the works of mercy , and appropriate relaxation in a spirit of joy \" are permitted . \\n  according to the usccb , this commandment \" has been concretized for catholics \" as one of the church precepts . the organization cites the papal encyclical dies domini : \\n  because the faithful are obliged to attend mass unless there is a grave impediment , pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept . ... yet more than a precept , the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of christian life . it is crucially important that all the faithful should be convinced that they cannot live their faith or share fully in the life of the christian community unless they take part regularly in the sunday eucharistic assembly . \\n  = = fourth commandment = = \\n  pope benedict xvi states that rabbi neusner \" rightly sees this commandment as anchoring the heart of the social order \" . it strengthens generational relationships , makes explicit the connection between family order and societal stability , and reveals that the family is \" both willed and protected by god . \" because parents \\' unconditional love for their children mirrors god \\'s love , and because they have a duty to pass the faith on to their children , the catechism calls the family \" a domestic church \" , \" a privileged community \" and the \" original cell of social life \" . \\n  the catechism says this commandment requires duties of children to parents that include : \\n  respect toward parents that also flows to brothers and sisters . \\n  gratitude , as expressed in a quote from sirach : \" remember that through your parents you were born ; what can you give back to them that equals their gift to you ? \" \\n  obedience to parents for as long as the child lives at home \" when it is for his good or the good of the family \" , except when obedience would require the child to do something morally wrong . \\n  support that requires grown children to offer material and moral support for their aging parents , particularly at times of \" illness , loneliness , or distress \" . \\n  keeping this commandment , according to the catechism , also requires duties of parents to children which include : \\n  \" moral education , spiritual formation and evangelization \" of their children . \\n  respect for their children as children of god and human persons . \\n  proper discipline for children while being careful not to provoke them . \\n  \" avoiding pressure to choose a certain profession or spouse \" , which does not preclude parents from giving \" judicious advice \" . \\n  \" being a good example \" to their children . \\n  \" acknowledging their own failings \" to their children to guide and correct them . \\n  = = = jesus \\' expansion = = = \\n  the gospel of matthew relates that when told his mother and brothers were waiting to see him , jesus replied , \" who is my mother and who are my brothers ? \" stretching his hand over his disciples he said , \" here are my mother and my brothers ! for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother , and my sister , and mother . \" pope benedict xvi stated that this dictum of jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level . by doing god \\'s will , any person can become part of the universal family of jesus . thus , the fourth commandment \\'s responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for \" legitimate social authorities \" . the catechism specifies \" duties of citizens and nations \" , which kreeft summarizes as : \\n  \" obedience and honor \" to \" all who for our good have received authority in society from god \" . \\n  \" payment of taxes , exercising the right to vote and defending one \\'s country \" . \\n  \" an obligation to be vigilant and critical \" , which requires citizens to criticize that which harms human dignity and the community . \\n  \" a duty to disobey \" civil authorities and directives that are contrary to the moral order . \\n  \" to practice charity \" , which is a \" necessity for any working family or society \" ; it is the \" greatest social commandment \" and requires people to love god and neighbor . \\n  \" to welcome the foreigner \" who is in need of security and livelihood that cannot be found in his own country . \\n  \" an obligation for rich nations to help poor nations \" , especially in times of \" immediate need \" . \\n  \" an expectation for families to help other families \" . \\n  = = fifth commandment = = \\n  this commandment demands respect for human life and is more accurately translated as \" thou shalt not murder . \" indeed , killing may , under limited circumstances , be justified within catholicism . jesus expanded it to prohibit unjust anger , hatred and vengeance , and to require christians to love their enemies . the basis of all catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the sanctity of life ethic , which kreeft argues is philosophically opposed to the quality of life ethic , a philosophy which he characterizes as introduced by a book entitled die freigabe der vernichtung des lebensunwerten lebens ( the permission to destroy life unworthy of life ) ( see life unworthy of life ) and which he asserts was the \" first to win public acceptance ... by german doctors before world war ii — the basis and beginning of nazi medical practices . \" this interpretation is supported by modern medical journals that discuss the dilemma posed by these opposing philosophies to physicians who must make life or death decisions . some bioethicists characterize the use of the \" nazi analogy \" as inappropriate when applied to quality of life decisions ; arthur caplan called this rhetoric \" odiously wrong \" . the church is actively involved in the public debates over abortion , capital punishment and euthanasia , and encourages believers to support legislation and politicians it describes as pro @-@ life . \\n  = = = abortion = = = \\n  the catechism states : \" human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of god and it remains forever in a special relationship with the creator , who is its sole end . ... no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being . \" direct and intentional killing of an innocent human is considered a mortal sin . considered by the church to be of an even greater gravity is the murder of family members , including \" infanticide , fratricide , parricide , the murder of a spouse and procured abortion . \" \\n  the catechism states that the embryo \" must be treated from conception as a person \" . the latin original of as is tamquam , meaning \" like \" or \" just as \" . \" although the church has not determined officially when human life actually begins , it has taken the course of maintaining that human life is present from the moment of conception or fertilization \" ; respect for life at all stages , even potential life , is generally the context of church documents . \\n  abortion has been specifically and persistently condemned by the church since the first century . \" formal cooperation \" in abortion incurs the penalty of excommunication \" by the very commission of the offense \" ( lat. latae sententiae , \" sentence [ already , i.e. automatically ] passed \" ) . the catechism emphasizes that this penalty is not meant to restrict mercy , but that it makes clear the gravity of the crime and the irreparable harm done to the child , its parents and society . \" formal cooperation \" in abortion extends not just to the mother who freely submits , but also to the doctor , nurses and anyone who directly aids in the act . the church has ministries of reconciliation , such as project rachel , for those who sincerely repent of their sin of formal cooperation in abortion . \\n  official church teaching allows for medical procedures and treatments intended to protect or restore the mother \\'s health if she would be in mortal danger without them , even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus . examples include the removal of a fallopian tube in the case of an ectopic pregnancy , removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus , or an appendectomy . \\n  = = = = use of embryos for research or fertilization = = = = \\n  the united states catechism for adults devotes a section to in vitro fertilization , stem @-@ cell research and cloning in its explanation of the fifth commandment , because these often involve the destruction of human embryos , considered to be a gravely sinful form of murder . embryonic stem cell research is called \" an immoral means to a good end \" and \" morally unacceptable . \" citing the congregation for the doctrine of the faith \\'s instruction on respect for human life in its origin and on the dignity of procreation , the us bishops quote : \" no objective , even though noble in itself , such as a foreseeable advantage to science , to other human beings , or to society , can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses , whether viable or not , either inside or outside the mother \\'s body . \" the bishops note that adult stem cell research , using cells obtained with informed consent , is a promising field of research that is morally acceptable . \\n  = = = suicide , euthanasia = = = \\n  the fifth commandment forbids suicide and the mercy killing of those who are dying , even to eliminate suffering . the ordinary care of those facing an imminent death may not morally be withheld , according to the church . \" ordinary care \" refers to food , water and pain relief , and does not include \" extraordinary care \" , which refers to the use of respirators or feeding tubes that are considered discretionary . allowing a terminally ill person to die , using painkillers that may shorten their life , or refusing extraordinary treatment to the terminally ill such as chemotherapy or radiation , are considered morally acceptable and not a violation of the fifth commandment , in accordance with the principle of double effect . \\n  = = = capital punishment = = = \\n  for the first two hundred years , christians \" refused to kill in the military , in self @-@ defense , or in the judicial system \" , but there was no official church position on the death penalty . when the church was first officially recognized as a public institution in 313 , its attitude toward capital punishment became one of toleration but not outright acceptance . the death penalty had support from early catholic theologians , though some of them such as saint ambrose encouraged members of the clergy not to pronounce or carry out capital punishment . saint augustine answered objections to capital punishment rooted in the first commandment in the city of god . thomas aquinas and duns scotus argued that civil authority to carry out capital punishment was supported by scripture . pope innocent iii required peter waldo and the waldensians to accept that \" secular power can , without mortal sin , exercise judgement of blood , provided that it punishes with justice , not out of hatred , with prudence , not precipitation \" as a prerequisite for reconciliation with the church . paul suris states that official church teachings have neither absolutely condemned nor promoted capital punishment , but toleration of it has fluctuated throughout the ages . the inquisitions provide the most memorable instance of church support for capital punishment , although some historians considered these more lenient than the secular courts of the period . \\n  the catechism of the catholic church states that the death penalty is permissible in cases of extreme gravity . it is allowed if the \" guilty party \\'s identity and responsibility have been fully determined \" and if the death penalty is the only way to defend others against the guilty party . however , if there are other means available to defend people from the \" unjust aggressor \" , these are preferred because they are considered to be more respectful of the dignity of the person and in keeping with the common good . because modern societies have effective means for preventing crime without execution , the catechism declares , \" the cases in which execution of the offender is an absolute necessity \\' are very rare , if practically nonexistent . \\' \" pope john paul ii discussed and affirmed this in evangelium vitae , published in 1995 . \\n  = = = personal health , dead bodies , burial = = = \\n  according to church teaching , respect for human life requires respect for one \\'s own body , precluding unhealthy behavior , the abuse of food , alcohol , medicines , illegal drugs , tattoos and piercings . the church also warns against the opposite behavior of \" excessive preoccupation with the health and welfare of the body that \\' idolizes \\' physical perfection , fitness , and success at sports . \" \\n  kidnapping , terrorism , and torture are forbidden , as well as sterilizations , amputations , mutilations that are not for therapeutic medical reasons . according to the catechism , societies have a moral obligation to strive to provide healthy living conditions for all people . \\n  church belief in the resurrection of the body led to a prohibition against cremation that was pastorally modified at the second vatican council in the 1960s under limited circumstances , but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy . according to the catechism , burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love ( e.g. scattering of cremated remains , burial in an unmarked grave , etc. are forbidden in the catholic church ) . organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms , also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted . \\n  = = = war and self @-@ defense = = = \\n  in the sermon on the mount , jesus recalls the commandment , \" you shall not kill \" and then adds to it the proscriptions against anger , hatred and vengeance . going further , christ asks his disciples to love their enemies . the catechism asserts that \" it is legitimate to insist on respect for one \\'s own right to life . \" kreeft says , \" self @-@ defense is legitimate for the same reason suicide is not : because one \\'s own life is a gift from god , a treasure we are responsible for preserving and defending . \" the catechism teaches that \" someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow . \" legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others . the defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm . for this reason , those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility . \\n  the church requires all to pray and work to prevent unjust wars , but allows for just wars if certain conditions are met : \\n  the reasons for going to war are defensive . \\n  \" the damage inflicted by the aggressor ... must be lasting , grave , and certain . \" \\n  it is a last resort taken only after all other means of putting an end to the \" grave damage \" have been ineffective . \\n  the ultimate aim is peace and there is a serious chance of success . \\n  no graver evils are produced that overshadow the evil to be eliminated . this forbids the use of arms to eliminate whole cities and areas with their inhabitants . \\n  respect and care is required for non @-@ combatants , wounded soldiers and prisoners . soldiers are required to disobey commands to commit genocide and ones that violate universal principles . \\n  = = = scandal = = = \\n  the catechism classifies scandal under the fifth commandment and defines it as \" an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil \" . in the gospel of matthew , jesus stated , \" whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea . \" the church considers it a serious crime to cause another \\'s faith , hope and love to be weakened , especially if it is done to young people and the perpetrator is a person of authority such as a parent , teacher or priest . \\n  = = sixth commandment = = \\n  according to the church , humans are sexual beings whose sexual identity should be accepted in the unity of body and soul . the sexes are meant by divine design to be different and complementary , each having equal dignity and made in the image of god . sexual acts are sacred within the context of the marital relationship that reflects a \" complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman . \" sexual sins thus violate not just the body but the person \\'s whole being . in his 1995 book crossing the threshold of hope , john paul ii reflected on this concept : \\n  after all , young people are always searching for the beauty in love . they want their love to be beautiful . if they give in to weakness , following the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a \\' scandal in the contemporary world \\' ( and these are , unfortunately , widely diffused models ) , in the depths of their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love . this is as true of boys as it is of girls . ultimately , they know that only god can give them this love . as a result , they are willing to follow christ , without caring about the sacrifices this may entail . \\n  like orthodox judaism and islam , the catholic church considers all sexual acts outside of marriage to be grave sins . the gravity of the sin \" \\' excludes one from sacramental communion \\' until repented of and forgiven in sacramental confession . \" \\n  = = = vocation to chastity = = = \\n  church teaching on the sixth commandment includes a discussion on chastity . the catechism describes chastity as a \" moral virtue ... a gift from god , a grace , a fruit of spiritual effort . \" the church sees sex as more than a physical act ; it also affects body and soul , so the church teaches that chastity is a virtue all people are called to acquire . it is defined as the inner unity of a person \\'s \" bodily and spiritual being \" that successfully integrates a person \\'s sexuality with his or her \" entire human nature . \" to acquire this virtue , followers are encouraged to enter into the \" long and exacting work \" of self @-@ mastery that is helped by friendships , god \\'s grace , maturity and education \" that respects the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life . \" the catechism categorizes violations of the sixth commandment into two categories : \" offenses against chastity \" and \" offenses against the dignity of marriage \" . \\n  = = = = offenses against chastity = = = = \\n  the catechism lists the following \" offenses against chastity \" in increasing order of gravity : \\n  lust : the church teaches that sexual pleasure is good and created by god , who meant for spouses to \" experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit \" . kreeft says , \" lust does not mean sexual pleasure as such , nor the delight in it , nor the desire for it in its right context . \" lust is the desire for sexual pleasure alone , outside its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman , body and soul , in mutual self @-@ donation . \\n  masturbation is considered sinful for the same reasons as lust , but is a step above lust in that it involves a physical act instead of a mental one . \\n  fornication is the sexual union of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman . this is considered contrary to \" the dignity of persons and of human sexuality \" because it is not ordered to the \" good of spouses \" or the \" generation and education of children . \" \\n  pornography ranks higher because it is considered a perversion of the sexual act that is intended for distribution to third parties for viewing . \\n  prostitution is considered sinful for both the prostitute and the customer ; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure , violating human dignity and harming society . the gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution , blackmail or social pressure . \\n  rape is an intrinsically evil act that can cause grave damage to the victim for life . \\n  incest , or \" rape of children by parents or other adult relatives \" or \" those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them \" is considered the most heinous of sexual sins . \\n  = = = = homosexuality = = = = \\n  the catechism devotes a separate section to homosexuality within its explanation of the sixth commandment . like heterosexual acts outside of marriage , homosexual acts are considered sins . the church distinguishes between homosexual attractions , which are not considered sinful , and homosexual acts , which are . the catechism states that they \" violate natural law , cannot bring forth life , and do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity . under no circumstances can they be approved . \" the church teaches that a homosexual inclination is \" objectively disordered \" and can be a great trial for the person , who the church teaches must be \" accepted with respect , compassion and sensitivity ... unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . \" \\n  homosexuals are , according to the church , \" called to chastity \" . they are instructed to practice the virtues of \" self @-@ mastery \" that teaches \" inner freedom \" using the support of friends , prayer and grace found in the sacraments of the church . these tools are meant to help homosexuals \" gradually and resolutely approach christian perfection \" , which is a state to which all christians are called . \\n  ( two lay movements represent opposing philosophies regarding homosexuality : dignityusa seeks to change the church \\'s teachings to justify homosexual acts ; courage international is an organization of homosexuals who \" support each other in the sincere effort to live in chastity and in fidelity to christ and his church \" . ) \\n  = = = love of husband and wife = = = \\n  according to church teaching , spousal love is intended to form an unbroken , two @-@ fold end : the union of husband and wife and the transmission of life . the unitive aspect includes the transference of each partner \\'s being \" so that they are no longer two but one flesh . \" the sacrament of matrimony is viewed as god \\'s sealing the consent which binds the partners together . church teaching on the marital state requires spousal acceptance of each other \\'s failures and faults , and the recognition that the \" call to holiness in marriage \" is one that requires a process of spiritual growth and conversion that can last throughout life . \\n  = = = = fecundity of marriage , sexual pleasure , birth control = = = = \\n  the church position on sexual activity can be summarized as : \" sexual activity belongs only in marriage as an expression of total self @-@ giving and union , and always open to the possibility of new life . \" sexual acts in marriage are considered \" noble and honorable \" and are meant to be enjoyed with \" joy and gratitude . \" sexuality is to be reserved to marriage : \" by its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of the spouses . this is the consequence of the gift of themselves which they make to each other . love seeks to be definitive ; it cannot be an arrangement \\' until further notice . \\' \" the \" intimate union of marriage , as a mutual giving of two persons , and the good of the children , demand total fidelity from the spouses and require an unbreakable union between them . \" ( gaudium et spes ) \" . \\n  artificial birth control predates christianity ; the catholic church has condemned these methods throughout its history . in response to the church of england accepting the practice of artificial contraception in 1930 , the catholic church issued the papal encyclical casti connubii on 31 december 1930 . the 1968 papal encyclical humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the catholic church \\'s traditional view of marriage and marital relations , and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control . \\n  the church seeing large families as a sign of god \\'s blessing . \" by its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring and it is in them that it finds its crowning glory . \" ( gaudium et spes ) children are the supreme gift of marriage and contribute greatly to the good of the parents themselves . ( ... ) true married love and the whole structure of family life which results from it , without diminishment of the other ends of marriage , are directed to disposing the spouses to cooperate valiantly with the love of the creator and savior , who through them will increase and enrich his family from day to day . ( gaudium et spes ) . \" it recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and considers natural family planning as morally acceptable , but rejects all methods of artificial contraception . the church rejects all forms of artificial insemination and fertilization because the techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child . the catechism states , \" a child is not something owed to one , but is a gift ... \\' the supreme gift of marriage . \\' \" \\n  many western catholics and non @-@ catholics have voiced disagreement on the church \\'s support for natural family planning , and contend it contributes to overpopulation and poverty . the church \\'s rejection of condom use is widely criticized , in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of aids and hiv has reached epidemic proportions . in its defense , catholics cite countries such as kenya and uganda , where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use , and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone . \\n  = = = = offenses against the dignity of marriage = = = = \\n  according to the church , adultery and divorce are considered offenses against the dignity of marriage and are defined as follows : \\n  adultery is the sexual union of a man and woman where at least one is married to someone else . it is for this reason that the church considers it a greater sin than fornication . kreeft states , \" the adulterer sins against his spouse , his society , and his children as well as his own body and soul . \" \\n  divorce : according to the catholic new american bible translation , jesus taught , \" whoever divorces his wife ( unless the marriage is unlawful ) causes her to commit adultery , and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery . \" explaining church interpretation of this teaching , kreeft says jesus considered divorce to be an accommodation that had slipped into jewish law . the church teaches that marriage was created by god and was meant to be indissoluble : like the creation of a child that cannot be \" un @-@ created \" , neither can the \" one flesh \" of the marriage bond . the catechism states , \" divorce is a grave offense against the natural law . it claims to break the contract , to which the spouses freely consented , to live with each other till death . \" by marrying another , the divorced person adds to the gravity of the offense as the remarried spouse is considered to be in a state of \" public and permanent adultery \" . \\n  the compendium of the catechism 502 lists other offenses against the dignity of marriage : \" polygamy , incest , free unions ( cohabitation , concubinage ) , and sexual acts before or outside of marriage \" . \\n  = = = = separation , civil divorce , annulments = = = = \\n  according to the church , there are situations that do not equate to divorce : \\n  in extreme situations , such as domestic violence , separation is allowed . this is not considered a divorce and may be justified . \\n  civil divorce is not a divorce according to the church . if it is deemed to be the only way of ensuring legal rights , care of children , or protection of inheritance , the church considers it morally acceptable . \\n  annulment is not a divorce ; it is a ruling by the church that the marriage was never valid . the marriage is deemed invalid if it lacks one of five integral elements : it should be \" complete \" , \" lifelong \" , \" mutual \" , a \" free gift \" and of \" man and woman \" . according to pope john paul ii \\'s address to the roman rota on 22 january 1996 , couples do not have a right to an annulment , but do have a right to make their case for nullity or validity before \" the competent church authority and to request a decision in the matter . \" according to the catholic diocese of arlington : \\n  ... signs that might indicate reasons to investigate for an annulment are : marriage that excluded at the time of the wedding the right to children , or to a permanent marriage , or to an exclusive commitment . in addition , there are youthful marriages ; marriages of very short duration ; marriages marked by serious emotional , physical , or substance abuse ; deviant sexual practices ; profound and consistent irresponsibility and lack of commitment ; conditional consent to a marriage ; fraud or deceit to elicit spousal consent ; serious mental illness ; or a previous bond of marriage . the determination of the ground should be made after extensive consultation with the parish priest or deacons , and based upon the proofs that are available . \\n  = = seventh commandment = = \\n  the catechism explains that this commandment regulates worldly goods , and forbids unjustly taking , using or damaging those that belong to someone else . it places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to use them responsibly , taking into consideration the good of society . the catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of god \\'s creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment . \\n  = = = private property = = = \\n  according to the church , people have a right to private property . however , ownership makes that person \" a steward \" who is expected to make it \" fruitful \" or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family . private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society . the taking of another \\'s private property \" in obvious and urgent necessity \" as \" the only way to provide for immediate , essential needs ( food , shelter , clothing ) \" is not considered by the church to be stealing . the concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the church , which classifies it as the stealing of a person \\'s human rights . \\n  = = = theft = = = \\n  according to the catechism , theft or stealing means \" usurping another \\'s property against the reasonable will of the owner \" though exclusion exists for someone in great need to survive . \" unjustly taking and keeping the property of others \" considered as theft , even if the act is outside the scope of civil law . cardinal christoph schönborn gave example from the story of saint augustine , written in his confessions , who took pears from neighbor \\'s garden when he was young . schönborn says that augustine still has \" pangs of conscience over a childish theft \" even when he became grown person , indicating that human conscience is very aware of theft though the act perhaps not an offense against civil law . \\n  following acts are also considered as violation of the seventh commandment : price manipulation to get advantage on the harm of others , corruption , appropriation of the public goods for personal interests , work poorly carried out , tax avoidance , counterfeiting of checks or any means of payment , any forms of copyright infringement and piracy , and extravagance . \\n  = = = social justice = = = \\n  the papal encyclical rerum novarum discusses the relationships and mutual duties between labor and capital , as well as government and its citizens . of primary concern was the need for some amelioration for \" the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class \" . the encyclical supported the right to form unions , rejected socialism , communism and unrestricted capitalism , and affirmed the right to private property . \\n  church interpretation of the seventh commandment teaches that business owners should balance a desire for profits that will ensure the future of the business with a responsibility toward the \" good of persons \" . business owners are required to pay their workers a reasonable wage , honor contracts , and abstain from dishonest activity , including bribery of government officials . workers are required to do their jobs conscientiously , as they have been hired to do them , and to avoid dishonesty in the workplace , such as using office goods for personal use without permission ( embezzlement ) . \\n  the church teaches that a balance should exist between government regulation and the laws of the marketplace . it deems that sole reliance on the marketplace ( pure capitalism ) insufficiently addresses many human needs , while sole reliance on government regulation ( pure socialism ) \" perverts the basis of social bonds \" . the church warns about the danger of either capitalism or socialism , as these systems tend to use excessive extremes that result in injustice to persons . \\n  wealthier nations , like wealthier individuals , have a moral obligation to help poorer nations and individuals , and work to reform financial institutions and economic factors to benefit all . \\n  = = eighth commandment = = \\n  the catechism explains that bearing false witness or \" speaking a falsehood with the intention of deceiving \" encompasses all violations of truth . these violations have degrees of gravity depending on the \" intentions of the one who lies and the harms suffered by its victims . \" listed as follows , these are : \\n  false witness and perjury : statements made publicly in court which obstruct justice by condemning the innocent or exonerating the guilty , or which may increase the punishment of the accused . \\n  rash judgement : believing , without sufficient evidence , that a person has done moral faults . \\n  detraction : the disclosure of another \\'s faults without a valid reason . \\n  calumny : lying to harm a person \\'s reputation and providing opportunity to others to make false judgements concerning them . \\n  flattery : \" speech to deceive others for our benefit . \" \\n  bragging , boasting , or mocking : speech which either only honors oneself or dishonors others . \\n  the church requires those who have damaged the reputation of another to \" make reparation for the untruth they have communicated . \" however , it does not require a person to reveal a truth to someone who does not have a right to know , and teaches respect for a right to privacy . priests are prohibited from violating the seal of confession no matter how grave the sin or its impact on society . \\n  included in the church teachings of this commandment is the requirement for christians to bear witness to their faith \" without equivocation \" in situations that require it . the use of modern media in spreading untruths , by individuals , businesses or governments , is condemned . \\n  = = ninth commandment = = \\n  the ninth and tenth commandments deal with coveting , which is an interior disposition not a physical act . the catechism distinguishes between covetousness of the flesh ( improper sexual desire ) and covetousness for another \\'s worldly goods . the ninth commandment deals with the former and the tenth the latter . \\n  jesus emphasized the need for pure thoughts as well as actions , and stated , \" everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart \" ( matthew 5 : 28 ) . the catechism states that , with the help of god \\'s grace , men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires \" for sinful relationships with another person \\'s spouse . \" in theology of the body , a series of lectures given by pope john paul ii , jesus \\' statement in matthew 5 : 28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another \\'s spouse , but also with his / her own spouse if one looks at him / her lustfully or treats him / her \" only as an object to satisfy instinct \" . \\n  purity of heart is suggested as the necessary quality needed to accomplish this task ; common catholic prayers and hymns include a request for this virtue . the church identifies gifts of god that help a person maintain purity : \\n  chastity , which enables people to love others with upright and undivided hearts . \\n  purity of intention , which seeks to fulfill god \\'s will in everything , knowing that it alone will lead to the true end of man . \\n  purity of vision , \" external and internal \" , disciplining the thoughts and imagination to reject those that are impure . \\n  prayer that recognizes the power of god to grant a person the ability to overcome sexual desires . \\n  modesty , of the feelings as well as the body is discreet in choice of words and clothing . \\n  jesus stated , \" blessed are the clean of heart , for they shall see god . \" this purity of heart , which the ninth commandment introduces , is the \" precondition of the vision of god \" and allows the person to see situations and people as god sees . the catechism teaches that \" there is a connection between purity of heart , of body and of faith . \" \\n  = = tenth commandment = = \\n  detachment from riches is the goal of the tenth commandment and the first beatitude ( \" blessed are the poor in spirit \" ) because , according to the catechism , this precept is necessary for entrance into the kingdom of heaven . covetousness is prohibited by the tenth commandment because it is considered to be the first step toward commission of theft , robbery and fraud ; these lead to violence and injustice . the church defines covetousness as a \" disordered desire \" that can take different forms : \\n  greed is the desire for too much of what one does not need . \\n  envy is the desire for what belongs to another . the us bishops define it as \" an attitude that fills us with sadness at the sight of another \\'s prosperity . \" \\n  explaining church teaching of this commandment , kreeft cites saint thomas aquinas , who wrote , \" an evil desire can only be overcome by a stronger good desire . \" the us bishops suggest that this can be achieved through cultivation of goodwill , humility and gratitude for one \\'s own and others \\' blessings , while trusting in god \\'s grace . kreeft explains that saint paul the apostle illustrated the concept in his letter to the philippians when he listed his worldly credentials as a respected jew and stated , \" i count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord . \" as jesus stated , \" what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? \" church teaching on the tenth commandment is directed toward this same attitude toward worldly goods , termed \" poverty of spirit \" . \\n  = yamaha ns @-@ 10 = \\n  the yamaha ns @-@ 10 is a loudspeaker that became a standard nearfield studio monitor in the music industry among rock and pop recording engineers . launched in 1978 , the ns @-@ 10 started life as a bookshelf speaker destined for the domestic environment . it was poorly received but eventually became a valuable tool with which to mix rock recordings . the speaker has a characteristic white @-@ coloured mid – bass drive unit . \\n  technically , it is known as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings . recording engineers sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it , resulting in what became known as the \" tissue paper effect \" , a type of comb filtering . the ns @-@

the $ 400 price point . the speaker was poorly received and its commercial life was short . however , it took five years for its popularity to be established with professional users . as recording engineers came to rely on the ns @-@ 10 as a benchmark , it dominated the mixing of pop and rock music throughout the world for at least 20 years . \\n  the ns @-@ 10 displaced the auratone 5c sound cube as the nearfield monitor of choice in the 1980s and was recognised for its ability to reveal shortcomings in recordings . it probably first reached american shores through a recording engineer \\'s visit to japan . the engineer , likely to have been greg ladanyi , monitored a recording session through the speaker in a japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the us . ladanyi then began using the speakers in a los angeles studio . other engineers heard the ns @-@ 10 for the first time and were impressed by its sound . its use spread to new york where the ns @-@ 10 was adopted at the power station and other studios . \\n  early use of the ns @-@ 10 among engineers include bob clearmountain , rhett davies , and bill scheniman in the us , and nigel jopson in the uk . clearmountain , then a rising star in record production , is often credited for the popularity of the ns @-@ 10 ; phil ward , writing in sound on sound , suggested that clearmountain was probably not the earliest , but was certainly the most influential early adopter . it became a legend that clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find . he was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones , and a pair of yamaha ns @-@ 10 , as a reference . \\n  recording studios around the world , particularly those specialising in rock and pop music , adopted the speaker as the standard . in excess of 200 @,@ 000 pairs were sold throughout the world . gizmodo referred to it as \" the most important loudspeaker you never heard of \" . \\n  yamaha stopped manufacturing the speaker in 2001 , citing problems sourcing the wood pulp for the drivers . even years after it was discontinued , the speaker continued to be found in studios everywhere . mix reported in 2008 that variants of the ns @-@ 10 were still commercially available in the japanese consumer market . \\n  = = design and construction = = \\n  the ns @-@ 10 is an 8 @-@ ohm two @-@ way loudspeaker with a 10 @.@ 4 @-@ litre sealed cabinet measuring 382 × 215 × 199 millimetres ( 15

domestic version of the speaker was vertically orientated , and came factory fitted with a grille . \\n  its two drivers are a 180 mm paper woofer and a 35 mm soft @-@ domed tweeter . the woofer \\'s diaphragm , weighing 3 @.@ 7 g , is manufactured from a flat sheet of pressed pulp paper . unconventionally , it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure , but by curling and then gluing the two ends together . against the black finish of the cabinet , the white bass / mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic feature of the product . \\n  the network is second @-@ order passive , crossing over at 2 khz . the frequency range is quoted from 60 hz to 20 khz , and rated power handling is 25 – 50 w. the early version of the speaker has press @-@ down type output terminals ; later models had screw terminals . \\n  = = signature sound = = \\n  in simplistic terms , the ns @-@ 10 possesses sonic characteristics that allow record producers to assume that if a recording sounds good on these monitors , then it should sound good on most playback systems . whilst it can reveal any shortcomings in the recording mix as well as the monitoring chain , it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in the domestic setting . \\n  the ns @-@ 10 does not have a perfectly flat frequency response . the sound of the ns @-@ 10 is slightly heavy in the midrange , and like other sealed @-@ box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited . it has a + 5 db boost in the midrange at around 2 khz , and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200 hz . the midrange response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst @-@ sounding to the human ear . \\n  on a practical level for the music professional , the speaker is analytic and clinical @-@ sounding . gizmodo likened the ns @-@ 10 to music editors who reveal the weaknesses of recordings , so that engineers would be forced to either make necessary compensation in the mix or otherwise rework them . \\n  a 2001 report by newell et al. at southampton university undertaken for studio sound in 2001 found that the ns @-@ 10 had excellent time @-@ domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input was found to be superior to that of most other nearfield monitors . part of this was related to its closed @-@ box design . the researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments ( guitar and drums ) are correctly balanced in the mix . \\n  = = product revisions = = \\n  there were many other versions of the ns @-@ 10 , the best known of which were the \" ns @-@ 10m studio \" and the \" ns @-@ 10m pro \" , both introduced in 1987 . technically identical to the \" studio \" , the \" pro \" comes fitted with a speaker grille and is meant to be used in a vertical orientation . \\n  the \" professional \" version launched some nine years after its first introduction on the back of the popularity of the ns @-@ 10 among engineers . the revised version , with everything including the logo and connection panel orientated horizontally , was badged \" ns @-@ 10m studio \" . improvements included a new tweeter and crossover to address the problem in the treble , better connection terminals , and a sturdier cabinet that no longer accommodates grilles . the studio reincarnation also has improved power handling – 60 – 120 w. in excess of 200 @,@ 000 pairs of \" studio \" alone were sold throughout the world . \\n  also in the product line @-@ up were ns @-@ 10t , ns @-@ 10m x , ns @-@ 10mc , ns @-@ 10mt . the ns @-@ 10m x is a \" studio \" with magnetic shielding and a different tweeter . in the 1990s yamaha introduced the ns @-@ 10mt , a bass @-@ reflex version of the 10m x with a different tweeter and grille . designed for home cinema , it has bass response down to 43 hz , nominal impedance of 6 ohm and maximum power handling rated at 180 w. a miniature version named natural sound surround speaker ns10mm was launched in 1997 or 1998 . \\n  = = reception = = \\n  the sound quality of the ns @-@ 10 has polarised opinions , characterised as \" love them or hate them \" . many professionals find it indispensable , even though they may not particularly enjoy listening to it ; others refuse to give it space in their studio but will happily admit that it is an effective professional tool . the reliance on the ns @-@ 10 by top independent producers became a viral phenomenon ; thousands of studios equipped themselves with ns @-@ 10s to attract big named producers , making the speakers an industry standard . \\n  = = tissue paper effect = = \\n  clearmountain was said to have been one of the first recording engineers to hang tissue paper over the tweeters of the ns @-@ 10 to tame the over @-@ bright treble . covering the tweeters with tissue paper was said to produce treble @-@ deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi @-@ fi . the phenomenon became the subject of hot debate . recording engineer bob hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper . he found inconsistent results with different paper , but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering , where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed . hodas derided the tissue practice as \" aberrant behaviour \" , saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects . he also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable . newell et al. noted that had the speakers \\' grilles been used in studios , where they are routinely removed , they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter . \\n  = = influence = = \\n  the speaker came to be relied on by independent engineers , who worked in different studios and needed equipment they were familiar with as a reference point . throughout the 1980s , engineers and producers worked widely with the speaker to monitor \" [ almost ]

and the russian baltic navy in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . the hemmema was initially developed for use against the russian navy in the archipelago sea and along the coasts of svealand and finland . it was designed by the prolific and innovative swedish naval architect fredrik henrik af chapman ( 1721 – 1808 ) in collaboration with augustin ehrensvärd ( 1710 – 1772 ) , an artillery officer and later commander of the swedish archipelago fleet . the hemmema was a specialized vessel for use in the shallow waters and narrow passages that surround the thousands of islands and islets extending from the swedish capital of stockholm into the gulf of finland . \\n  the hemmema replaced the galleys that had made up the core of the swedish archipelago fleets until the mid @-@ 18th century . compared to galleys , the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars , but offered superior accommodation for the crew , carried more stores , was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns . it could be propelled by either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships , which made it suitable for operations in confined waters . \\n  between 1764 and 1809 , sweden built six hemmemas . the hemmema became the largest and most heavily armed vessel in the archipelago fleet and served in the russo @-@ swedish war of 1788 – 90 . oden , the first hemmema , was relatively small and very similar to a turuma , a different type of \" archipelago frigate \" . russia built six hemmemas based on the swedish design between 1808 and 1823 after capturing three of the swedish vessels at the surrender of sveaborg in 1808 . the later versions , both swedish and russian , were much larger and much more heavily armed than oden . \\n  = = background = = \\n  russian tsar peter the great had established a new capital and powerful naval base in saint petersburg in 1703 . russian naval power in the baltic grew to challenge the interests of sweden , the other leading power in the baltic . swedish holdings at that time included territory in northern germany , all of modern finland and most of the baltic states , a dominion depending on , and connected by , the baltic sea trade routes . during the great northern war ( 1700 – 1721 ) , sweden lost all its territories in the baltic states and suffered russian raids in finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos stretching from the gulf of finland to stockholm . the swedes began to deploy inshore flotillas of shallow @-@ draft vessels , beginning with smaller versions of the traditional mediterranean galleys . most of these new vessels were more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams . the disastrous war with russia ( 1741 – 43 ) and the minor involvement against prussia in the seven years \\' war ( 1757 – 62 ) showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels . \\n  galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations , but were severely under @-@ gunned , especially in relation to their large crews ; a galley with a 250 @-@ man crew , most of whom were rowers , would typically carry only one 24 @-@ pounder cannon and two 6 @-@ pounders , all in the bow . the galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower @-@ soldiers , many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741 – 43 . \\n  = = = archipelago fleet = = = \\n  after the russian victory against sweden in 1743 , the swedes established a commission to identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses . in 1747 , the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern finland needed to be improved and expanded , and that sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy . augustin ehrensvärd ( 1710 – 72 ) , an artillery officer , was the driving force behind these changes . the committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas . in 1756 , sweden established the archipelago fleet with the official name arméns flotta ( \" fleet of the army \" ) under the command of the army department , krigskollegium , with ehrensvärd as supreme commander . for two decades , the struggle for power between the hats and the caps , the dominant political factions at the time , and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to the archipelago fleet . the parliamentary victory of the hats in the riksdag in 1769 – 70 and the coup d \\'ètat by king gustav iii in 1772 secured the archipelago fleet \\'s status as an independent branch of the army . starting in 1770 , the archipelago fleet merged with the finnish squadron ( finska eskadern ) based at sveaborg . in 1777 , it incorporated the swedish squadron ( svenska eskadern ) , the galley fleet based at stockholm . the swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional , independent organization . the archipelago fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of king gustav iii , who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup . \\n  after the poor performance of galleys in russo – swedish war of 1741 – 43 and the pomeranian war ( 1757 – 62 ) , development of replacements became prioritized . during the pomeranian war , trials had been made with \" gun prams \" ( skottpråmar ) , heavily armed , oar @-@ driven , flat @-@ bottomed barges with a shallow draft that carried guns in broadside arrangements . the prams carried more guns than the galleys , but proved far too slow to be effective . augustin ehrensvärd argued for new archipelago vessels that combined firepower , maneuverability , seaworthiness , and decent crew accommodations . he began a successful collaboration with shipwright fredrik henrik chapman ( ennobled \" af chapman \" in 1772 ) , and together they developed five new vessels : a gunboat with a 12 @-@ pounder gun and a schooner rigging , as well as four types of \" archipelago frigates \" ( skärgårdsfregatter ) : the smaller udema and pojama , and the larger turuma and hemmema . all four types have been called skärgårdsfregatter ( archipelago frigates ) in swedish and english historical literature , though some authors have called the udema and pojama \" archipelago corvettes \" . chapman specifically designed the archipelago frigates for service off the south coast of finland and named them after the finnish provinces of uusimaa , pohjanmaa ( österbotten ) , turunmaa ( åboland ) , and hämeenmaa ( tavastia ) . \\n  = = development = = \\n  the concept of small sailing frigates with a complementary set of oars ( or \" sweeps \" ) was not new . the english tudor navy had used small \" galleasses \" in the mid @-@ 16th century . in the 1660s its successor , the royal navy , equipped the equivalent of sixth @-@ rates with oar ports on or below the gundeck . during the 18th century the russian navy introduced \" shebecks \" , baltic variants on the mediterranean xebecs , for inshore duties . the xebecs were good sailers , could be rowed if necessary and had more guns and greater stores than galleys ; they were also less expensive to maintain . the russian designs influenced chapman and the swedish naval commanders . consequently , chapman \\'s designs for new ships were elaborations on those principles , but with adaptations to archipelago warfare . \\n  chapman \\'s archipelago frigates provided better protection for their crew than the galleys they replaced , and up to three times the capacity for stores and provisions . they could operate in the narrow , shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water in all but the worst storms . they had a deeper draft than galleys , but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships . the new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet \\'s firepower , provided it with better defensive capabilities , and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations . \\n  = = design and construction = = \\n  of the new designs , turumas and hemmemas best fit the description of \" archipelago frigate \" because of their similarities to small ocean @-@ going frigates . the first hemmema , the oden , was completed in 1764 . it was c . 33 m ( 108 @.@ 2 ft ) long and 8 @.@ 2 m ( 26 @.@ 8 ft ) wide with a draft of 2 @.@ 8 m ( 9 @.@ 25 ft ) . it had a low hull with no forecastle , only a low quarterdeck , and no poop deck . it had three masts that were initially rigged with lateen sails , like a galley . the navy later replaced the lateen rigs with a more conventional square @-@ sail frigate rig . the early design provided for 14 pairs of oars with four men per oar . the rowers plied their oars from the gun deck through oar ports positioned between the gunports , close to the waterline , which gave the rowers better leverage . the oars were also placed on a rectangular outrigger , designed to further improve the leverage . even so , hemmemas performed poorly when rowed and were difficult in contrary winds . they were slower than ordinary sailing ships , but sailed better than galleys . \\n  during the russian war of 1788 – 1790 , sweden built three hemmemas of a new design . they were considerably larger , 44 @.@ 5 by 11 m ( 146 by 36 ft ) , and the number of oars were increased to 20 pairs . they also had some of the heaviest broadsides , even when compared with the much larger frigates of the high seas navy . the artillery officer carl fredrik aschling had cooperated with chapman to increase the main armament to twenty @-@ two 36 @-@ pounders and two 12 @-@ pounders , which increased the draft by about 30 cm ( 1 ft ) . the addition of diagonal bracers to reinforce the hull allowed the later hemmemas to carry guns more powerful even than those on the largest sailing frigates of the high seas navy . due to their considerable firepower and relative size , naval historian jan glete has described the hemmemas as \" super archipelago frigates \" . \\n  the hemmema \\'s design was very similar to that of the turuma . the primary difference was that the turuma \\'s oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns , whereas the hemmema \\'s oarsmen sat on the gundeck . the later hemmemas were considerably larger , more heavily armed , and of a more robust construction . glete has described them as variations on the same type , especially when considering the pre @-@ war designs . \\n  = = service = = \\n  hemmemas served in the finnish squadrons during the war of 1788 – 1790 . they supported amphibious operations and conducted raids on the russian archipelago fleet , while at the same time acting as sea @-@ borne flank support for the swedish army on the finnish mainland . hemmemas fought in the first and second battles of svensksund . during the first battle in 1789 , one hemmema complemented the similar turumas , and in the second battle in july 1790 , two hemmemas made up the defensive center and provided a considerable percentage of the firepower . \\n  the swedes were building three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of sveaborg when it was surrendered to the russians in 1808 , and all three were incorporated in the russian navy . shortly afterward , the russian navy built its own 32 @-@ gun versions , with the final vessel launched as late as 1823 . two more were built in sweden in 1809 , birger jarl and erik segersäll . birger jarl sank in an accident in 1813 and erik segersäll was planned for conversion as a paddlewheel steam battery for coastal defense , though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in 1826 . \\n  like the other specialized archipelago vessels , the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses . although it had superior firepower relative to galleys , its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars , it was still difficult to propel while rowed . a hemmema had the potential to be an effective weapon against galleys , matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament . inside an enemy galley formation , it could wreak considerable havoc , but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle , leaving that tactical role untested . \\n  = = ships = = \\n  a total of twelve hemmemas were built , six of them for the swedish archipelago fleet and six for the russian navy . details of individual vessels are listed below . the swedish hemmemas were all built to the same specifications , except for the early design oden , and birger jarl and erik segersäll carried heavier armament than the others . tredrea and sozaev list oden as a turuma rebuilt as a hemmema in 1784 , though oscar nikula and lars @-@ otto berg do not . the russian vessels were built between 1808 and 1823 and have been described by tredea and sozaev as bodryi @-@ class \" rowing frigates \" . \\n  under the finnish form \" hämeenmaa \" , the name of the ship type was later carried on to several vessels of the 20th century finnish navy . \\n  = edward creutz = \\n  edward creutz ( january 23 , 1913 – june 27 , 2009 ) was an american physicist who worked on the manhattan project at the metallurgical laboratory and the los alamos laboratory during world war ii . after the war he became a professor of physics at the carnegie institute of technology . he was vice president of research at general atomics from 1955 to 1970 . he published over 65 papers on botany , physics , mathematics , metallurgy and science policy , and held 18 patents relating to nuclear energy . \\n  a graduate of the university of wisconsin – madison , creutz helped princeton university build its first cyclotron . during world war ii he worked on nuclear reactor design under eugene wigner at the metallurgical laboratory , designing the cooling system for the first water @-@ cooled reactors . he led a group that studied the metallurgy of uranium and other elements used in reactor designs . in october 1944 , he moved to the los alamos laboratory , where he became a group leader . \\n  after the war ended , creutz accepted an offer to come to the carnegie institute of technology , where he became the head of its physics department and its nuclear research center in 1948 . in 1955 he returned to los alamos to evaluate its thermonuclear fusion program for the atomic energy commission . while there he accepted an offer to become vice president for research and development and the director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science at general atomics . under his leadership , general atomics developed triga , a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories . \\n  creutz served as an assistant director of the national science foundation from 1970 to 1977 , and then as director of the bernice pauahi bishop museum in honolulu , where he took particular interest in the museum \\'s preparation of a manual of the flowering plants of hawaii \\' . \\n  = = early life = = \\n  edward chester creutz was born on january 23 , 1913 , in beaver dam , wisconsin , the son of lester creutz , a high school history teacher , and grace smith creutz , a general science teacher . he had two older brothers , john and jim , and a younger sister , edith . the family moved to eau claire , wisconsin , in 1916 , monroe , wisconsin , in 1920 , and to janesville , wisconsin , in 1927 . he played a number of musical instruments , including the mandolin , ukulele and trombone . he played in the school bands at janesville high school and monroe high school . at janesville he played tenor banjo in a dance orchestra called rosie \\'s ragadors , and timpani with the school orchestra at monroe . he also played left guard on the american football teams at janesville and monroe . he expressed an interest in chemistry , biology , geology and photography . \\n  after graduating from janesville high school in 1929 , he took a job as a bookkeeper at a local bank . in 1932 , his brother john , who had graduated from the university of wisconsin – madison with a degree in electrical engineering , persuaded him to go to college as well . john suggested that \" if you aren ’ t sure what part of science you want , take physics , because that \\'s basic to all of them . \" creutz later recalled that this was the best advice he ever got . he entered the university of wisconsin and studied mathematics and physics . money was scarce during the great depression , especially after his father died in 1935 . to pay his bills , creutz worked as a dishwasher and short order cook , and took a job taking care of the physics laboratory equipment . in 1936 , his senior year , he taught physics laboratory classes . \\n  creutz encountered several members of the faculty at the university of wisconsin , including julian mack , ragnar rollefson , raymond herb , eugene wigner and gregory breit . mack gave creutz a research project to do in his junior year . creutz remained at wisconsin as a graduate student after receiving his bachelor of science ( b.s. ) degree in 1936 , working for herb upgrading the departmental van de graaff generator from 300 to 600 kev . with this done , the question became what to do with it , and breit suggested that it had previously been observed that high @-@ energy gamma rays were produced when lithium was bombarded with protons at 440 kev . creutz therefore wrote his 1939 doctor of philosophy ( ph.d. ) thesis on resonance scattering of protons by lithium , under breit \\'s supervision . creutz married lela rollefson , a mathematics student at wisconsin , and the sister of ragnar rollefson , on september 13 , 1937 . the couple had three children , two sons , michael and carl , and a daughter , ann jo . \\n  wigner moved to princeton university in 1938 , and soon after creutz received an offer as well . princeton had been given a 36 @-@ inch ( 910 mm ) magnet by the university of california , which had been used to build an 8 mev cyclotron . they wanted creutz to help get it operational . he later recalled : \\n  on my third day in princeton i was invited to give a short report on my thesis work . there were usually two or three speakers at these \" journal club \" meetings . this time the speakers were niels bohr , albert einstein , and ed creutz . to be on the same program with these two giants of scientific accomplishments was breathtaking . just before the meeting began , my sponsor , delsasso , asked me , \" say , creutz , have you met einstein yet ? \" i had not . delsasso took me over to where einstein was sitting in sweatshirt and tennis shoes , and said , \" professor einstein , this is creutz who has come to work on our cyclotron . \" the great man held out his hand , which seemed as big as a dinner plate , and said in an accented voice , \" i ’ m glad to meet you , dr. creutz . \" i managed to wheeze out , \" i ’ m glad to meet you , too , dr. einstein . \" \\n  but it was bohr who electrified the audience with his news from europe of the discovery by lise meitner and otto frisch of nuclear fission . physicists rushed to confirm the results . creutz built an ionization chamber and a linear amplifier out of radio vacuum tubes , coffee cans and motorcycle batteries , and with this apparatus the physicists at princeton were able to confirm the results . \\n  = = world war ii = = \\n  in the early years of world war ii between 1939 and 1941 , wigner led the princeton group in a series of experiments involving uranium and two tons of graphite as a neutron moderator . in early 1942 , arthur compton concentrated the manhattan project \\'s various teams working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design , including wigner \\'s team from princeton , at the metallurgical laboratory at the university of chicago . the name was a codename ; creutz was the first to conduct actual metallurgy research , and he hired its first metallurgist to work with him . \\n  wigner led the theoretical group that included creutz , leo ohlinger , alvin m. weinberg , katharine way and gale young . the group \\'s task was to design the reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium . at the time , reactors existed only on paper , and no reactor had yet gone critical . in july 1942 , wigner chose a conservative 100 mw design , with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling . the choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time because water was known to absorb neutrons , thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor ; but wigner was confident that his group \\'s calculations were correct and that water would work , while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolant would delay the project . working seven days a week , the group designed the reactors between september 1942 and january 1943 . creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water @-@ cooled system , and designed the cooling system . in 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of creutz , ohlinger , weinberg , wigner , and young . \\n  as a group leader at the metallurgical laboratory , creutz conducted studies of uranium and how it could be extruded into rods . his group looked into the process of corrosion in metals in contact with fast @-@ flowing liquids , the processes for fabricating aluminium and jacketing uranium with it . it also investigated the forging of beryllium , and the preparation of thorium . frederick seitz and alvin weinberg later reckoned that the activities of creutz and his group may have reduced the time taken to produce plutonium by up to two years . \\n  the discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor @-@ bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium @-@ 240 led wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium @-@ 233 from thorium , but the challenge was met by the los alamos laboratory developing an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon design . in october 1944 , creutz moved to los alamos , where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing . difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led to the construction of a special test area in pajarito canyon , and creutz became responsible for testing there . as part of the preparation for the trinity nuclear test , creutz conducted a test detonation at pajarito canyon without nuclear material . this test brought bad news ; it seemed to indicate that the trinity test would fail . hans bethe worked through the night to assess the results , and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion . \\n  = = later life = = \\n  after the war ended in 1945 , creutz accepted an offer from seitz to come to the carnegie institute of technology as an associate professor , and help create a nuclear physics group there . creutz in turn recruited a number of young physicists who had worked with him at princeton and on the manhattan project in chicago and los alamos , including martyn foss , jack fox , roger sutton and sergio debenedetti . together , with funding from the office of naval research they built a 450 mev synchrotron at the nuclear research center near saxonburg , pennsylvania . for a time , this put them at the forefront of research into nuclear physics , allowing physicists there to study the recently discovered pi meson and mu meson . a visiting scholar , gilberto bernardini , created the first photographic emulsion of a meson . \\n  creutz became a professor , the head of the physics department , and the head of nuclear research center at the carnegie institute of technology in 1948 . he was also a member of the executive board at the argonne national laboratory from 1946 to 1958 , and a consultant at the oak ridge national laboratory from 1946 to 1958 . in addition to his work on nuclear physics , he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home . he published eight papers on floral species , and named three varieties of violets after his children . one 1966 paper , published in the new york botanical garden journal was on apetahia raiateensis , a rare flower found only on the island of raiatea in french polynesia . he travelled to polynesia many times , and translated grammar of the tahitian language from french into english . his family served as hosts for a time to two young people from tahiti and samoa . \\n  in 1955 and 1956 , creutz spent a year at los alamos evaluating its thermonuclear fusion program for the atomic energy commission . while there he was approached by frederic de hoffmann , who recruited him to join the general atomics division of general dynamics . he moved to la jolla , california , as its vice president for research and development , and was concurrently the director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science from 1955 to 1967 . he was also a member of the advisory panel on general science at the department of defense from 1959 to 1963 . \\n  under his leadership , general atomics developed triga , a small reactor for universities and laboratories . triga used uranium zirconium hydride ( uzrh ) fuel , which has a large , prompt negative fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity . as the temperature of the core increases , the reactivity rapidly decreases . it is thus highly unlikely , though not completely impossible , for a nuclear meltdown to occur . due to its safety and reliability , which allows it to be installed in densely populated areas , and its ability to still generate high energy for brief periods , which is particularly useful for research , it became the world \\'s most popular research reactor , and general atomics sold 66 trigas in 24 countries . the high @-@ temperature gas @-@ cooled reactor ( htgr ) was less successful , and only two htgr power reactors were built , both in the united states . a 40 mw demonstration unit at the peach bottom nuclear generating station in pennsylvania operated successfully , but a larger 300 mw unit at the fort st. vrain generating station in colorado encountered technical problems . general atomics also conducted research into thermonuclear energy , including means of magnetically confining plasma . between 1962 and 1974 creutz published six papers on the subject . \\n  in 1970 president richard nixon appointed creutz as assistant director for research of the national science foundation . he became assistant director for mathematical and physicals sciences in 1975 , and was acting deputy director from 1976 to 1977 . the 1970s energy crisis raised the national profile of energy issues , and creutz served on a panel that produced a study called the nation \\'s energy future . his wife lela died of cancer in 1972 . in 1974 he married elisabeth cordle , who worked for the national science board . the two of them enjoyed locating and photographing rare orchids . \\n  his appointment at the national science foundation ended in 1977 , and creutz became director of the bernice pauahi bishop museum in honolulu . he took particular interest in the museum \\'s work preparing a two @-@ volume manual of the flowering plants of hawaii , which was published in 1999 . he expanded programs for education and outreach , and secured funding for two new buildings . he retired in 1987 and returned to his home in rancho santa fe , california , and died there on june 27 , 2009 . \\n  = = documentaries = = \\n  to mars by a @-@ bomb :

western area campaigns during 1944 . \\n  through march – april 1944 , the beaufighters attacked japanese shipping , while the mitchells and beauforts bombed timor on a daily basis as a prelude to operations reckless and persecution , the invasions of hollandia and aitape . eaton organised a large raid against su , dutch timor , on 19 april . consisting of thirty @-@ five mitchells , beauforts and beaufighters , the force destroyed the town \\'s barracks and fuel dumps , a result that earned the personal congratulations of the air officer commanding nwa , air vice marshal \" king \" cole . on the day of the allied landings , 22 april , the mitchells and beaufighters made a daylight raid on dili , portuguese timor . the ground assault on hollandia – aitape met little opposition , credited in part to the air bombardment leading up to it . \\n  in may 1944 , nos. 1 , 18 and 31 squadrons attacked japanese positions in timor , while no. 2 squadron was withdrawn from combat to re @-@ equip with mitchells . no. 79 wing \\'s light and medium bombers suffered from a lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel . no. 2 squadron returned

were cut back in march , as preparations were made to transfer the mitchells to jacquinot bay in new britain . on 6 april , all twenty available aircraft of nos. 2 and 18 squadrons were ordered to join b @-@ 24 liberators of no. 82 wing in an assault on a japanese convoy that included the cruiser isuzu . the liberators were late for their rendezvous with the mitchells off sumba so the latter , at the very limit of their range , attacked the convoy regardless . they claimed two direct hits without loss , despite anti @-@ aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships , and frontal attacks by enemy fighters . allied submarines sank the damaged isuzu the next day . \\n  the wing \\'s proposed move to new britain was cancelled in may 1945 , after the netherlands government requested that its

there , she put her younger brother and sister through school , while studying stenography and working for a living . \\n  she soon became a private secretary to the president of the title guarantee and trust company . the bank , which held many assets of the oregon common school fund , failed during hobbs \\' time there . ben olcott , who was the secretary of state and a member of the state land board , was charged with protecting the common school fund , and was involved in negotiating with the failing bank over the state \\'s assets . he took note of hobbs \\' strong loyalty to her employer . \\n  after the bank \\'s failure , hobbs worked as a governess for j. wesley ladd ( brother of william s. ladd ) in portland . she also helped raise her younger brother and sister , studied stenography and the law , and worked as a secretary . in 1913 , hobbs graduated from willamette university college of law with a bachelor of laws degree , and was admitted to the oregon state bar . \\n  olcott , who managed oswald west \\'s successful 1910 campaign to become governor of oregon , recommended that west hire hobbs as his private stenographer . she was hired , and impressed west to the point that he hired her as his private secretary two years later . at that time , at age 27 , she was the highest @-@ paid woman in public service in the united states , earning $ 3 @,@ 000 per year . \\n  = = martial law in copperfield , oregon = = \\n  west ordered hobbs to copperfield , oregon to restore law and order on january 2 , 1914 , along with a group of six militia men that included oregon state penitentiary warden b.k. lawson . copperfield , located on the snake river in baker county , had grown up around construction projects for a railroad tunnel and power plant . fifteen @-@ hundred jobs in the area came from the railway project of e. h. harriman or the power generation facility . \\n  the town had descended into lawlessness with a number of saloons , brothels , dancing halls , and widespread gambling . the town had no law enforcement officers , and the local government officials had become bar keepers . governor west had extended prohibition laws , some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance. but they were widely ignored in copperfield . over half the residents of the town had signed a petition , addressed to west , alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and city council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours . governor west responded by ordering county officials to restore order , close the saloons , and force the resignations of the corrupt city leaders by december 25 , 1913 . \\n  county officials did not take care of the problem , so west sent hobbs , hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence . hobbs was a petite woman standing 5 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 63 m ) tall and weighing less than 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) . she was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary . while hobbs was traveling to eastern oregon , both she and governor west were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia men , suggesting that hobbs might be acting alone . \\n  the saloon keepers , who received word that hobbs was accompanied by law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival , greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting , blue and pink ribbons , and flowers . a town meeting was arranged at 2 : 30 p.m. on january 3 . hobbs renewed the call for the resignation of city officials , but was the request was refused . hobbs \\' escorts then arrested the city leaders and ordered lawson to declare martial law . it was the first time in oregon since the civil war that martial law was put into effect . \\n  soon the town was disarmed and order restored , with the gambling equipment and weapons confiscated , and the saloons closed down . hobbs then left lawson in charge and caught the 4 : 00 p.m. train out of town that same day . the residents did not openly resist hobbs or the militia men , although nearly all were armed and had been prepared to offer non @-@ violent resistance . she stopped at the county seat in baker city to officially remove the town \\'s officials in front of a judge before returning to the state capitol in salem . the baker county circuit court quickly enjoined the militia from holding the town under martial law ; sheriff rand began assembling a posse to carry out the court order . governor west requested a hearing , seeking rand \\'s temporary removal from office , and appointed hobbs to represent the state as special counsel . \\n  the actions of the governor were later challenged in court , with hobbs and west among the defendants . the saloon keepers sought remuneration for liquor they claimed was confiscated during the period of martial law . the baker county circuit court determined the governor \\'s actions were within his powers , and the oregon supreme court ultimately concurred . \\n  these events made hobbs the most famous woman in oregon at that time . hobbs also made national and international news for these events . writer stewart holbrook reported : \\n  = = later life = = \\n  after the copperfield affair , hobbs continued as governor west \\'s secretary until the end of his term in 1915 . she visited the union county town of cove in february 1914 , also to investigate complaints about a saloon . a local election had declared the town \" dry , \" but a county election had declared the entire county \" wet . \" on advice of a judge , the mayor of cove stated that he was unable to determine whether the saloon was legal or not , but expressed deference to the governor \\'s wishes . hobbs did not order the saloon closed down . \\n  she then moved to portland and practiced law . women \\'s rights groups promoted hobbs as a candidate to run for governor , but she never ran for office . within a few years fern hobbs became the commissioner of oregon state industrial accident commission , working on getting taxes due on the oregon & california lands . in 1917 , with the united states entering world war i , she began a long association with the red cross . from 1917 to 1922 she worked in europe , including time spent as the chief of the casualty division in paris , france . in that position hobbs was responsible for notifying dead soldiers \\' next of kin . she returned to europe in the 1930s , working in the rhine valley when it was occupied by france . \\n  upon returning to oregon , hobbs worked as a secretary for the oregon journal newspaper . she retired in 1948 as the secretary to the paper \\'s business manager . fern hobbs died on april 10 , 1964 , at the age of 80 , and was buried at the hillsboro pioneer cemetery in hillsboro , oregon . \\n  the oregon writer stewart holbrook interviewed her in the early 1950s , a few years after her

studio album by american jazz saxophonist and composer ornette coleman . it was recorded on april 25 , 1979 , at cbs studios in new york city with his band prime time , which featured guitarists charlie ellerbee and bern nix , bassist jamaaladeen tacuma , and drummers calvin weston and coleman \\'s son denardo . it followed coleman \\'s failed attempt to record a direct @-@ to @-@ disc session earlier in march 1979 . \\n  of human feelings explores jazz @-@ funk music and continues coleman \\'s harmolodic approach to improvisation with prime time , whom he introduced on his 1975 album dancing in your head . he drew on rhythm and blues influences from early in his career for of human feelings , which had shorter and more distinct compositions than dancing in your head . coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk . \\n  following a change in management , coleman signed with island records , and of human feelings was released in 1982 by its subsidiary label antilles records . critics generally praised coleman \\'s expressive music and harmolodic approach , but the album made little commercial impact and went out of print . coleman enlisted his son denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album \\'s royalties , a change that inspired him to perform publicly again during the 1980s . \\n  = = background = = \\n  by the end of the 1960s , ornette coleman had become one of the most influential musicians in jazz after pioneering its most controversial subgenre , free jazz , which jazz critics and musicians initially derided for its deviation from conventional structures of harmony and tonality . in the mid @-@ 1970s , he stopped recording free jazz , recruited electric instrumentalists , and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics . according to coleman \\'s theory , all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key , and still sound coherent as a group . he taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach , based on their individual tendencies , and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles . coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \" collective consciousness \" that stresses \" human feelings \" and \" biological rhythms \" , and said that he wanted the music , rather than himself , to be successful . he also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music , including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non @-@ western rhythms played by moroccan and nigerian musicians . \\n  of human feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach coleman had applied with prime time , an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album dancing in your head . the group comprised guitarists charlie ellerbee and bern nix , bassist jamaaladeen tacuma , and drummers ronald shannon jackson and denardo coleman , ornette coleman \\'s son . tacuma was still in high school when coleman enlisted him , and first recorded with prime time in 1975 for the album body meta , which was released in 1978 . tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist charles earland , but earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing . coleman found tacuma \\'s playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change . although coleman \\'s theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music , tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist : \" when we read ornette \\'s music we have his notes , but we listen for his phrases and phrase the way he wants to . i can take the same melody , then , and phrase it like i want to , and those notes will determine the phrasing , the rhythm , the harmony – all of that . \" \\n  in march 1979 , coleman went to rca records \\' new york studio to produce an album with prime time by direct @-@ to @-@ disc recording . they had mechanical problems with the studio equipment and the recording was rejected . the failed session was a project under phrase text , coleman \\'s music publishing company . he wanted to set up his own record company with the same name , and chose his old friend kunle mwanga as his manager . in april , mwanga arranged another session at cbs studios in new york city , and coleman recorded of human feelings there on april 25 ; the session was originally titled fashion faces . jackson did not record with the band and calvin weston was hired in his place to play simultaneously with denardo coleman . they recorded all the album \\'s songs on the first take without any equipment problems . the album was recorded with a sony pcm @-@ 1600 two @-@ track digital recorder , a rare item at the time . according to journalist howard mandel , the passages played by the band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album , because it had been mixed with a middle @-@ frequency range and compressed dynamics . because of the equipment used , coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing , multi @-@ tracking , and remixing . according to him , of human feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the united states . \\n  = = composition = = \\n  according to the concise oxford dictionary of music ( 2004 ) , of human feelings features jazz @-@ funk , a type of music that originated around 1970 and was characterized by intricate rhythmic patterns , a recurrent bass line , and latin rhythmic elements . lloyd sachs of the chicago sun @-@ times wrote that , although coleman was not viewed as a jazz fusion artist , the album can be described as such because of its combination of free jazz and funk . glenn kenny disagreed and felt its boisterous style had more in common with the no wave genre and the artists of new york city \\'s downtown music scene such as john zorn . jazz writer stuart nicholson viewed it as the culmination of coleman \\'s musical principles that dated back to his free jazz music in 1960 , but reappropriated with a funk @-@ oriented backbeat . according to jazz critic barry mcrae , \" it was as if coleman was translating the concept of the famous double quartet \" from his 1961 album free jazz to what was required to perform jazz @-@ funk . \\n  coleman incorporated traditional structures and rhythms , and other elements from the rhythm and blues music he had played early his career . according to mandel , the album \\'s simple , brisk music was more comparable to a coherent r & b band than jazz fusion . although coleman still performed the melodies on a song , he employed two guitarists for contrast to make each pair of guitarist and drummer responsible for either the rhythm or melody . ellerbee provided accented linear counterpoint and nix played variations of the song \\'s melody , while denardo coleman and weston played both polyrhythms and backbeats . tacuma and ornette coleman \\'s instrumental responses were played as the foreground to the less prominent guitars . mcrae remarked that coleman and prime time exchanged \" directional hints \" throughout the songs , as one player changed key and the others modulated accordingly . the band made no attempt to harmonize their radically different parts . \\n  of human feelings features shorter and more distinct compositions than dancing in your head . \" sleep talk \" , \" air ship \" , and \" times square \" were originally performed by coleman during his concerts in 1978 under the names \" dream talking \" , \" meta \" , and \" writing in the streets \" , respectively . \" what is the name of that song ? \" was titled as a sly reference to two of his older compositions , \" love eyes \" and \" forgotten songs \" ( also known as \" holiday for heroes \" ) , whose themes were played concurrently and transfigured by prime time . the theme from \" forgotten songs \" , originally from coleman \\'s 1972 album skies of america , was used as a refrain . \\n  on songs such as \" jump street \" and \" love words \" , ellerbee incorporated distortion into his guitar playing , which gave the songs a thicker texture . \" jump street \" is a blues piece , \" air ship \" comprises a six @-@ bar riff , and the atonal \" times square \" has futuristic dance themes . \" love words \" heavily uses polymodality , a central feature of harmolodics , and juxtaposes coleman \\'s extended solo against a dense , rhythmically complex backdrop . nicholson observed west african rhythms and collective improvisation rooted in new orleans jazz on \" love words \" , and suggested that \" sleep talk \" was derived from the opening bassoon solo in igor stravinsky \\'s 1913 orchestral work the rite of spring . \\n  = = release and reception = = \\n  a few weeks after of human feelings was recorded , mwanga went to japan to negotiate a deal with trio records to have the album released on phrase text . trio , who had previously released a compilation of coleman \\'s 1966 to 1971 live performances in paris , prepared to press the album once mwanga provided the label with the record stamper . coleman was also set to perform his song \" skies of america \" with the nhk symphony orchestra , but cancelled both deals upon mwanga \\'s return from japan . mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as coleman \\'s manager . in 1981 , coleman hired stan and sid bernstein as his managers , who sold the album \\'s recording tapes to island records . he signed with the record label that year , and of human feelings was released in 1982 on island \\'s subsidiary jazz label antilles records . billboard magazine published a front @-@ page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in new york city and the first digital jazz album recorded by an american label . \\n  according to jazz writer francis davis , \" a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent \" for coleman , who appeared to be regaining his celebrity . german musicologist peter niklas wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial @-@ sounding of his career at that point . the album \\'s clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by mandel , who described its production as \" the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere \" . of human feelings had no success on the american pop charts , only charting on the top jazz albums , where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15 . because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz , mcrae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners . sound & vision critic brent butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments , rock and funk drumming , and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre \\'s fans preferred . the album later went out of print . \\n  of human feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics . in a review for esquire , gary giddins hailed it as another landmark album from coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics , partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless . in his opinion , the discordant keys radically transmuted conventional polyphony and would be the most challenging part for listeners , whom he said should concentrate on coleman \\'s playing and \" let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center \" . kofi natambu from the detroit metro times said coleman \\'s synergetic approach displayed expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \" a multi @-@ tonal mosaic of great power , humor , color , wit , sensuality , compassion and tenderness \" . he found the songs inspirational , danceable , and encompassing developments in african @-@ american music over the previous century . robert christgau found the music heartfelt and sophisticated in its exchange of rhythms and simple pieces of melody , writing in the village voice , \" the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian . \" \\n  purist critics in jazz complained about the music \\'s incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar . in stereo review , chris albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused . dan sullivan of the los angeles times argued that the album \\'s supporters in \" hip rock circles \" had overlooked flaws ; he felt tacuma and coleman \\'s playing sounded like a unique \" beacon of clarity \" amid an incessant background . leonard feather wrote in the toledo blade deemed the music stylistically ambiguous , potentially controversial , and difficult to assess but interesting enough to warrant a listen . at the end of 1982 , billboard editor peter keepnews named of human feelings the year \\'s best album , calling it a prime example of fusing free jazz with modern funk . in year @-@ end lists for the boston phoenix , james hunter and howard hampton ranked the album number one and number four , respectively . it was voted 13th best in the pazz & jop , an annual poll of american critics nationwide , published in the village voice . christgau , the poll \\'s supervisor , ranked it number one in an accompanying list , and in 1990 he named it the second @-@ best album of the 1980s . \\n  coleman received $ 25 @,@ 000 for the publishing rights to of human feelings but said his managers sold it for less than the recording costs and that he did not receive any of its royalties . according to stan bernstein , coleman had financial expectations that were \" unrealistic in this business unless you \\'re michael jackson \" . antilles label executive ron goldstein felt the $ 25 @,@ 000 coleman received was neither a great nor a fair amount for someone in jazz . after he had gone over budget to record a follow @-@ up album , island did not release it nor pick up their option on him , and in 1983 , he left the bernstein agency . he chose denardo coleman to manage his career while overcoming his reticence of public performance , which had been rooted in his distrust of doing business with a predominantly white music industry . according to nicholson , \" the man once accused of standing on the throat of jazz was welcomed back to the touring circuits with both curiosity and affection \" during the 1980s . coleman did not record another album for six years and instead performed internationally with prime time . \\n  in a 1986 article for the new york times on coleman \\'s work with prime time , robert palmer said of human feelings was still innovative and radical by the standards of other music in 1982 , three years after it was recorded . because writers and musicians had heard its test pressing in 1979 , the album \\'s mix of jazz improvisation and gritty , punk and funk @-@ derived energy sounded \" prophetic \" when it was released , palmer explained . \" the album is clearly the progenitor of much that has sounded radically new in the ongoing fusion of punk rock , black dance rhythms , and free jazz . \" allmusic critic scott yanow believed that although coleman \\'s compositions never achieved popularity , they succeeded within the context of an album that showcased his distinctive saxophone style , which was high @-@ brow yet catchy . joshua klein from the a.v. club recommended of human feelings as the best album for new listeners of coleman \\'s harmolodics @-@ based music , while chicago tribune rock critic greg kot included it in his guide for novice jazz listeners ; he named it one of the few albums that helped him both become a better listener of rock music and learn how to enjoy jazz . in 2008 , new york magazine \\'s martin johnson included it in his list of canonical albums from what he felt had been new york \\'s sceneless yet vital jazz scene in the previous 40 years ; of human feelings exuded what he described as a spirit of sophistication with elements of funk , latin , and african music , all of which were encapsulated by music that retained a jazz identity . \\n  = = track

: zhōu tóng ) ( died late 1121 ce ) was the archery teacher and second military arts tutor of famous song dynasty general yue fei . originally a local hero from henan , he was hired to continue yue fei \\'s military training in archery after the boy had rapidly mastered spearplay under his first teacher . in addition to the future general , zhou accepted other children as archery pupils . during his tutelage , zhou taught the children all of his skills and even rewarded yue with his two favorite bows because he was his best pupil . after zhou \\'s death , yue would regularly visit his tomb twice a month and perform unorthodox sacrifices that far surpassed that done for even beloved tutors . yue later taught what he had learned from zhou to his soldiers and they were successful in battle . \\n  with the publishing of yue fei \\'s 17th folklore biography , the story of yue fei ( 1684 ) , a new distinct fictional zhou tong emerged , which differed greatly from his historical persona . not only was he now from shaanxi ; but he was yue \\'s adopted father , a learned scholar with knowledge of the eighteen weapons of war , and his personal name was spelled with a different , yet related , chinese character . the novel \\'s author portrayed him as an elderly widower and military arts tutor who counted lin chong and lu junyi , two of the fictional 108 outlaws on which the water margin is based , among his former pupils . a later republican era folktale by noted yangzhou storyteller wang shaotang not only adds wu song to this list , but represents zhou as a knight @-@ errant with supreme swordsmanship . the tale also gives him the nickname \" iron arm \" , which he shares with the executioner @-@ turned @-@ outlaw cai fu , and makes the outlaw lu zhishen his sworn brother . because of his association with the outlaws , he is often confused with the similarly named outlaw zhou tong . \\n  various wuxia novels and folk legends have endowed zhou with different kinds of martial and supernatural skills . these range from mastery of the bow , double broadswords , and chinese spear to that of wudang hard qigong and even x @-@ ray vision . practitioners of eagle claw , chuojiao and xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with yue fei , the supposed progenitor of these styles . he is also linked to northern praying mantis boxing via lin chong and yan qing . wang shaotang \\'s folktale even represents him as a master of drunken eight immortals boxing . however , the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to yue fei . nothing is ever said about him knowing or teaching a specific style of chinese martial arts . \\n  zhou has appeared in various forms of media such as novels , comic books , and movies . his rare 20th century biography , iron arm , golden sabre , serves as a sequel to the story of yue fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking yue as his pupil . this was later adapted into a ten volume lianhuanhua comic book . he also appears in a novel concerning one of his fictional martial arts brothers . he was portrayed by three different actors in a string of black and white yue fei films produced in the 1940s and 1960s , one of which featured a ten @-@ year @-@ old sammo hung as the lead . veteran martial arts actor yu chenghui , who played the sword @-@ wielding antagonist in jet li \\'s shaolin temple , stated in a 2005 interview that he has always wanted to portray zhou in a film . \\n  = = history = = \\n  = = = mention in yue family memoirs = = = \\n  on his deathbed , yue fei \\'s third son yue lin ( 岳霖 , born 1130 ) asked his own son , the poet and historian yue ke ( 岳珂 , 1183 – post @-@ 1240 ) , to complete yue fei \\'s memoirs . this two @-@ part memoir was completed in 1203 , some sixty years after the general \\'s political execution , but was not published until 1234 . it was later abridged in 1345 and published in the yuan dynasty \\'s dynastic chronology history of the song dynasty under the title yue fei biography ( chapter 365 , biography 124 ) . zhou \\'s mention in yue ke \\'s memoir was only briefly summarized in the yuan rewrite . it reads , \" he [ yue fei ] learned archery from zhou tong . he learned everything and could fire with his left and right hands . after tong \\'s death , he would offer sacrifices at his tomb \" . \\n  western washington university history professor edward kaplan explains zhou was a \" local hao \" ( 豪 - \" heroic ( person ) \" ) . he comments hao can also mean \" a \\' knight errant \\' in poetic translation , or in prosaic terms a professional strongman and bodyguard . \\' \" this means zhou was a local hero from tangyin county , anyang prefecture , henan province ( the same area as yue fei ) . \\n  historical and scholarly sources spell his personal name as 同 ( tong ) , meaning \" same or similar \" . this differs from the spelling present in fictional sources , which will be further explained below . so , \" 周同 \" represents the historical archer . \\n  = = = tutelage = = = \\n  despite being literate , giving him a chance to become a scholar , young yue fei chose the military path because there had never been any tradition of full @-@ fledged confucian civil service in his family history . he would stay up all night reading military strategy books and idolized such great historical heroes as guan yu . however , the yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son , so , yao dewang , the boy \\'s maternal grandfather , hired chen guang ( 陈广 ) to teach the eleven @-@ year @-@ old how to wield the chinese spear . yao was very surprised when his grandson quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen . zhou was then brought in to continue yue \\'s military training in archery . dr. kaplan describes zhou as the \" most important \" of the two teachers . \\n  a section of the jin tuo xu pian , the second part of yue ke \\'s original published memoir , describes one of zhou \\'s archery lessons and reveals that he took other children as his pupils : \\n  \" one day , [ chou ] t \\'ung gathered his pupils for an archery session and to display his ability put three arrows in succession into the center of the target . pointing to the target to show grandfather [ yue fei ] , he said : \\' after you can perform like this , you can say you are an archer \\' . grandfather , thanked him and asked to be allowed to try . he drew his bow , let fly his arrow and struck the end of t \\'ung \\'s arrow . he shot again and again hit the mark . t \\'ung was greatly amazed and subsequently presented to grandfather his two favorite bows . thereafter grandfather practiced still more [ until ] he was able to shoot to the left and right , accurately letting fly the arrow as he moved . when he became a general he taught this to his officers and men so that his whole army became skilled at shooting to the left and right and frequently used this technique to crush the enemy \\'s spirit \" . \\n  the last sentence of the passage is similar to one from the republican era biography of song yue , prince of e. but instead of teaching them his own technique , it states yue taught what he had learned from zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle . \\n  = = = death = = = \\n  zhou continued to teach the children until his death , prior to yue \\'s legal adulthood . following his passing , yue became extremely depressed since zhou had been the greatest influence on his early life . zhou \\'s student would regularly visit his tomb on the first and fifteenth of every month with sacrifices of meat and wine and would shoot three arrows in succession with one of the two bows his tutor had presented him with ( it is never mentioned whether any of zhou \\'s other archery pupils came to visit his tomb ) . dr. kaplan comments this continuous unusual display of mourning \" went far beyond the ceremonial appropriate for even a highly respected teacher \" . noted sinologist hellmut wilhelm claims even though the display of grief was genuine , it was also a way of emulating the stories of his heroic idols and \" [ establishing himself ] in the public eye \" . yue \\'s father later followed him secretly to zhou \\'s tomb after striking him during an argument over his melancholic behavior . there , he saw him perform the unorthodox obediences involving the meat , wine , and three arrows . when he finally confronted him , the son confessed that \" his gratitude for chou \\'s instruction could not be requited simply by the usual first and middle of the month ceremonies and so he ... shot off the three arrows to symbolize that chou had been the source of his inspiration as an archer \" . dr. kaplan \\'s states this happened just prior to yue \\'s entrance into the army and that the entire event served as a symbol for yue \\'s \" entrance into responsible manhood \" . \\n  the chronology of yue wumu lists the events at zhou \\'s tomb happening in 1121 when yue was nineteen , but yue would have been eighteen in that year since he was born on \" the fifteenth day of the second month of 1103 \" . the author of the original source material was using xusui age calculation , in which a child is already considered one year old at birth . since yue joined the military shortly after zhou \\'s death , a relative time frame can be given for when he died . during the early months of 1122 , the song empire mobilized its armed forces to assist the jurchen in confronting their common enemy , the liao dynasty . therefore , it appears that zhou died in late 1121 , before the call to arms was issued . \\n  = = fiction = = \\n  zhou tong \\'s fictional life story can be pieced together from two sources : the story of yue fei and iron arm , golden sabre . the story of yue fei is a fictionalized retelling of yue fei \\'s young life , military exploits , and execution . it was written by a native of renhuo named qian cai ( 钱彩 ) , who lived sometime between the reigns of the kangxi and qianlong emperors in the qing dynasty . the preface dates the book \\'s publication to 1684 . it was deemed a threat by the qing emperors and banned during the qianlong era . in the novel , zhou is portrayed as an elderly widower and yue \\'s only military arts tutor . the general \\'s historical spear master chen guang is never mentioned . zhou teaches yue fei and his sworn brothers military and literary arts from chapters two through five , before his death . \\n  in the writing of his novel , qian cai used a different character when spelling zhou \\'s given name . instead of the original character meaning \" similar \" , it was changed to 侗 , meaning \" rude or rustic \" . so , \" 周侗 \" represents zhou \\'s distinct fictional persona . this spelling has even been carried over into modern day martial arts manuals . \\n  iron arm , golden sabre was written by wang yun heng and xiao yun long and published in 1986 . this novel , which serves as zhou \\'s own fictional biography , is a prequel to the story of yue fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking yue fei as his student . it follows his life as a young martial arts instructor in the song army \\'s imperial guard , his struggles against the xixia and liao tartar barbarian tribes and his tutelage of water margin outlaws . the last few chapters incorporate the storyline from the four chapters that he appears in the story of yue fei . this was later adapted into a ten volume lianhuanhua @-@ style comic book called the legend of zhou tong in 1987 . \\n  = = = early life and adulthood = = = \\n  zhou is born in shaanxi and trains in the martial arts from a young age . he is taken as one of the pupils of shaolin master tan zhengfang ( 谭正芳 ) and , learning the true essence of shaolin kungfu , becomes proficient in things both literary and martial . tan \\'s other students include the future generals jin tai ( 金台 ) and zong ze ( 宗澤 ) and the future water margin outlaws sun li and luan tingyu . as a young man , zhou catches the attention of judge bao zheng and enlists in the military as an officer . his superiors take note of his great skill after he helps his classmate general jin battle liao tartars in northern china and install him as a teacher in the capital imperial martial arts school . the school has three teaching positions named in order of prestige : \" heaven , \" \" earth , \" and \" man . \" since he has the greatest skill , he occupies the heaven position . he uses this post and his friendship with general zong to get their classmate sun li installed as the superintendent of forces of dengzhou . sun later becomes an outlaw under chao gai and helps defeat the evil zhu family , who learn military arts from his classmate luan tingyu . \\n  as he grows older , zhou becomes dissatisfied with politics because the imperial court chooses to appease the northern barbarian tribes instead of standing against them . he then devotes himself wholeheartedly to his martial arts practice and creates several official and authoritative techniques including the \" five step , thirteen lance piercing kick \" , which is a development of shaolin fanzi boxing , and the \" zhou tong cudgel . \" he makes a concerted effort to transmit his martial efforts while teaching at the imperial martial arts school and formally accepts two disciples : \" jade unicorn \" lu junyi and \" panther head \" lin chong . lu junyi is a millionaire with vast land holdings and does not hold office , but lin chong inherits zhou \\'s position after his retirement , and continues to serve as the lead instructor for the 800 @,@ 000 members of the song army \\'s imperial guard . \\n  during this time , zhou tong also has an additional disciple named wu song . wu song becomes famous for killing a man @-@ eating tiger with his bare hands and is appointed as a constable in his native shandong . the county magistrate sun guoqin later sends wu on a mission to kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages . during his stay in the capital , he makes the acquaintance of zhou . zhou finds wu to be a man of great strength , but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and , therefore , offers guidance for wu \\'s training . unfortunately , these two men only interact for a brief two months before wu has to return home , never to see zhou again . \\n  following his retirement , zhou serves for a time as an advisor to general liu guangshi ( 劉光世 ) , whose troops are garrisoned in henan province . but zhou later becomes an outlaw himself after he aids the heroes of the water margin and is forced to flee from government forces . meanwhile , he learns his elderly classmate jin tai is close to death and hurries to shaolin ( where the general had become a buddhist monk after the murder of his family ) to pay his last respects . as the oldest of tan \\'s pupils , jin orders zhou to find a talented youth to pass on all of his martial arts knowledge to . however , this reunion is cut short when the troops track him to shaolin . he flees to wine spring mountain and lives in hiding for sometime before being invited by his old friend wang ming ( 王明 ) to become the precept of the wang family in unicorn village . \\n  = = = old age and death = = = \\n  one day , zhou surprises the children with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor . wang \\'s son , wang gui ( 王贵 ) , tricks their maid \\'s son , yue fei , into completing their assignment while they go outside to play . after easily finishing the task at hand , yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name . the children then burst into the classroom upon learning of zhou \\'s forthcoming return and tell yue to escape in order to avoid apprehension . the old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and , after marveling at yue \\'s impromptu ballad , asks yue to fetch his mother , lady yao ( 姚夫人 ) , for an important meeting . with the entire wang household assembled in the main hall , zhou asks the lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student . she consents and yue takes his seat amongst zhou \\'s students the following morning . because zhou knows yue is poor , he commands the four students to become sworn brothers . zhou also begins to teach yue all of the eighteen weapons of war . \\n  six years later , zhou takes the group to visit his old friend , the abbot of a small buddhist temple on the \" hill of dripping water \" . thirteen @-@ year @-@ old yue wanders behind the temple and finds the \" cave of dripping water \" , in which lives a magical snake . when it lunges at yue , he dodges to one side and pulls on its tail with his supernatural strength , causing it to turn into an 18 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) , gold @-@ plated spear named the \" supernatural spear of dripping water \" . when they return home , zhou begins to drill all of his students in the military arts — eighteen weapons of war , archery , and hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . after three years of practice , zhou enters them into a preliminary military examination in tangyin in which sixteen @-@ year @-@ old yue wins first place by shooting a succession of nine arrows through the bullseye of a target two hundred and forty paces away . after his display of marksmanship , yue is asked to marry the daughter of li chun ( 李春 ) , an old friend of zhou \\'s and the county magistrate who presided over the military exams . father and son then return home to their village . \\n  magistrate li writes out a marriage certificate and dispatches a messenger to deliver the document to yue fei in unicorn village . zhou and yue set out at dawn and travel back to tangyin to thank the magistrate for his generosity and kindness . there , li prepares a great feast for them , but when food is brought out for any servants that might have accompanied them , zhou comments that they had come on foot without help . li decides to let yue pick from any one of his thousands of horses because every able military man needs a strong steed . after finishing their feast , zhou and yue thank li once again and leave tangyin to return home . during their journey , zhou recommends that yue run the horse to test its speed . yue spurs the horse on leaving zhou in pursuit . when they reach the village gate , the two dismount and zhou returns to his study where he feels hot from the race and removes his outer garments to fan himself . but he soon falls ill and stays bedridden for seven days . then the book describes his death and burial : \\n  \" ... his phlegm bubbled up and he died . this was on the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the seventeenth year of the reign of xuan he , and his age was seventy @-@ nine ... buddhist and taoist priests were asked to come and chant prayers , for seven times seven , namely forty @-@ nine days . then the body was taken up to be buried beside the hill of dripping water \" . \\n  yue lives in a shed by his grave through the winter and in the second lunar month of the following year , his martial brothers come and pull the building down , forcing him to return home and take care of his mother . \\n  the quoted death date is not only unreliable because the book is fiction , but also because the xuan he reign era of emperor huizong lasted only seven years ( 1119 – 1125 ) and not seventeen . although the story of yue fei states zhou died shortly before yue took a wife , he historically died after yue married . it is likely that the original author invented this fictional date . \\n  = = = family = = = \\n  according to the story of yue fei , zhou was married with a son . but zhou comments that his \" old wife \" died and his \" small son \" was killed in battle against the liaos after leaving with the outlaw lu junyi to fight in the war . in the legend of zhou tong , his wife is named meng cuiying ( 孟翠英 ) and his son is named zhou yunqing ( 周云清 ) . he defeats meng in a lei tai martial arts contest and wins her as his wife . but she is shortly thereafter kidnapped by the wicked monks of the stone buddha temple . both zhou and meng eventually defeat the monks with their combined martial skills and later marry at the miaochuan pass in hubei province . \\n  zhou yunqing first appears as a fierce , impulsive young man who rides his horse into the thick of enemy encampments wielding a long spear . he later dies in battle against the liao dynasty . after his son \\'s death , zhou retreats to the xiangguo temple for a long morning period . he later takes seven @-@ year @-@ old yue fei as his adopted son and sole heir years after the boy \\'s father drowns in a great flood : \\n  \" i see that he [ yue fei ] is clever and handsome and i , an old man , wish to have him as my adopted son ... he need change neither his name nor his surname . i only want him to call me father temporarily so that i can faithfully transmit all the skills i have learned in my life to a single person . later , when i die , all he has to do is to bury my old bones in the earth and not allow them to be exposed , and that is all \" . \\n  however , after comparing events from the story of yue fei and an account of yue \\'s life from the sixteenth @-@ century work restoration of the great song dynasty : the story of king yue ( 大宋中興岳王傳 ) , literary critic c.t. hsia concluded \" that his father did not [ historically ] die in the flood and that , although yueh fei showed almost filial regard for the memory of his teacher chou t \\'ung 同 ( not 侗 ) , the latter had not been his adopted father \" . the restoration of the great song was one of the earliest of four \" historical novels \" ( fictionalized dynastic chronologies ) written about yue during the ming dynasty , all of which predate the story of yue fei . despite the addition of popular legends , xiong damu ( fl 1552 ) , the author of the the story of king yue , relied heavily on historical chronologies including zhu xi \\'s ( 1130 – 1200 ) outlines and details based on the t \\'ung @-@ chien , yue ke \\'s family memoir , and the yuan dynasty \\'s official yue fei biography to write his story . so , the story of yue fei was the first full @-@ blown fictionalized novel to introduce the adoption storyline . \\n  = = = appearance and voice = = = \\n  he is generally portrayed as a large elderly man with a powerful voice . a modern folktale by noted yangzhou storyteller wang shaotang ( 1889 – 1968 ) , whom folklore researcher vibeke børdahl called \" the unrivaled master of this [ the 20th ] century \" , describes zhou thus , \\n  \" he was beyond the age of fifty , he was more than fifty , and standing upright he measured about eight feet . his face had a golden tan , arched brows , a pair of bright eyes , a regular head form , a square mouth , a pair of protruding ears , and under his chin there were three locks of beard , a grizzled beard . on his head he wore a sky @-@ blue satin scarf , and he was dressed in a stately sky @-@ blue satin coat with a silken girdle , a pair of wide black trousers without crotch and satin boots with thin soles \" . \\n  heroes and religious masters with above normal height are a recurring theme in chinese folklore . for instance , his student wu song is said to be over nine feet tall in the same folktale . in the story of yue fei , the general simultaneously duels with two other warriors vying for first place in a military exam ; one is nine feet tall and the other is eight feet tall . a hagiography of the taoist saint zhang daoling states he was over seven feet tall . \\n  when zhou is vocalized in \" yangzhou storytelling \" , he speaks in \" square mouth public talk \" , which is a manner of speaking reserved for martial heroes , highly respected characters , or , sometimes , lesser characters that pretend to be an important hero . square mouth public talk is actually a mixture of two forms of dialogue : fangkou and guanbai . fangkou ( square mouth ) is a manner of steady , yet forceful over pronunciation of dialogue that was possibly influenced by northern chinese opera . guanbai ( public talk ) is monologue and dialogue that is sometimes used for \" imposing heroes \" . this mixture of styles means zhou tong is treated as a highly regarded hero . \\n  in her analysis of yangzhou storytelling , børdahl noted that the aforementioned tale about zhou and wu song uses different forms of dialogue for both characters . wu speaks square mouth utilizing standard mandarin without rusheng ( short glottal syllables ) . on the contrary , zhou speaks squaremouth using the yangzhou tone system , which does utilize rusheng syllables . therefore , she believes \" square mouth dialogue should at least be divided into two subcategories , namely the wu song variant — without rusheng , and the zhou tong variant — with rusheng \" . \\n  = = = students = = = \\n  = = = = water margin outlaws = = = = \\n  the water margin ( c . 1400 ) is a ming dynasty military romance about one hundred and eight demons @-@ born @-@ men and women who band together to rebel against the lavish song dynasty government . lin chong and lu junyi , two of these outlaws , are briefly mentioned as being zhou \\'s previous students in the story of yue fei . they are not characters within the main plot , though , as both are killed by \" villainous officials \" prior to zhou becoming precept of the wang household . most importantly , the two were not among his historical students since they are fictional characters . \\n  zhou \\'s portrayal as their teacher is connected to a recurring element in chinese fiction where tang and song dynasty heroes train under a \" celestial master \" , usually a taoist immortal , prior to their military exploits . c.t. hsia suggests the mold from which all other similar teachers are cast is guiguzi , master of the feuding strategists sun bin and pang juan , from the yuan dynasty tale latter volume of the spring and autumn annals of the seven kingdoms ( 七國春秋後集 ) . hsia goes on to say that qian cai , yue \\'s fictional biographer , associated zhou with the outlaws because \" most such teachers [ in the military romance genre ] are celestials \" with at least two students . but in adopting this format , qian reversed the traditional pattern of \" celestial tutelage \" since zhou is written as a human , while his students are reincarnations of demons ( lin and lu ) and the celestial bird garuda ( yue fei ) . \\n  although lin and lu have been connected to zhou since the early qing dynasty , wu song did not become associated with him until wang shaotang created a 20th @-@ century folktale in which the two meet in kaifeng . the tale takes place during wu \\'s mission to kaifeng , but before the murder of his older brother wu dalang . zhou teaches wu the \" rolling dragon \" style of swordplay during the constable \\'s one @-@ month stay in the capital city . this tale was chapter two of wang \\'s \" ten chapters on wu song \" storytelling repertoire , which was later transcribed and published in the book wu sung in 1959 . it eventually carried over into the storyline of iron arm , golden sabre and , subsequently , the legend of zhou tong . in the latter version , wu instead learns chuo jiao boxing from zhou during a two month stay in the capital . \\n  wang \\'s tale portrays zhou as an aging itinerant swordmaster with \" a fame reverberating like thunder \" throughout the underworld society of jianghu . he is made the sworn brother of the outlaw \" flowery monk \" lu zhishen , a military officer @-@ turned @-@ fighting monk , who is , according to hsia , first among the most popular protagonists of the water margin . he is also given the nickname \" iron arm \" ( 铁臂膀 ) , which carried over into the title of his fictional biography iron arm , golden sabre . while the tale fails to explain the reason for the moniker , it does mention zhou \\'s ability to direct his qi to any part of his body to make it hard enough to overpower the \" iron shirt \" technique of another martial artist . furthermore , zhou shares the same nickname with cai fu , an executioner @-@ turned @-@ outlaw known for his ease in wielding a heavy sword . \\n  because of his association with these outlaws , zhou is often confused with the similarly named outlaw \" little conqueror \" zhou tong . in the water margin , this zhou tong is a bandit chief of mount peach blossom whom lu zhishen beats for trying to forcibly marry the daughter of the liu family . he dies later under the sword of li tianrun , an officer in the rebel army of fang la . so , the connection between both zhou \\'s is based solely on the romanized transcription of their name . \\n  = = = = yue fei = = = = \\n  the story of yue fei comments lu junyi is zhou \\'s last student prior to taking on seven @-@ year @-@ old yue fei and his three sworn @-@ brothers wang gui , tang huai ( 湯懷 ) and zhang xian ( 張顯 ) . he teaches them literary and military lessons on even and odd days . the novel says yue is talented in all manners of \" literary and military matters \" and even surpasses the skill of lin and lu . after yue acquires his \" supernatural spear of dripping water \" , zhou tutors all of his students in the eighteen weapons of war , but each excels with one in particular ; yue fei and tang huai , the spear ; zhang xian , the hook @-@ sickle spear and wang gui , the yanyue dao . all of them learn the skill of archery in addition . some of these and other children are mentioned in yue ke \\'s memoir as being his grandfather \\'s historical childhood friends , but they are never specified as being zhou \\'s students . \\n  books written by modern @-@ day martial artists make many claims that are not congruent with historical documents or current scholarly thought . for instance , internalist yang jwing @-@ ming says zhou was a scholar who studied martial arts in the shaolin monastery and later took yue as his student after the young man worked as a tenant farmer for the official @-@ general han qi ( 韓琦 , 1008 – 1075 ) . during this time , he learned all types of military weapons , horseback riding , and hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . the general later created xingyi and eagle claw boxing from his internal and external training under zhou . however , history prof. meir shahar notes that unarmed boxing styles did not develop at shaolin until the late ming dynasty . he also states that ji family memoirs and qing dynasty records suggest xingyi was created hundreds of years after the death of yue by a spearplayer named ji jike ( fl . 1651 ) . in addition , the appearance of han qi in the story is a chronological anachronism since he died nearly 30 years before yue \\'s birth . yue historically worked as a tenant farmer and bodyguard for descendants of han qi in 1124 after leaving the military upon the death of his father in late 1122 , but he learned from zhou well before this time . \\n  eagle claw grandmasters leung shum and lily lau believe \" jow tong \" ( the cantonese rendering of his name ) was a monk who brought young yue to the shaolin monastery and taught him a set of hand techniques , which yue later adapted to create his ying kuen ( eagle fist ) . liang shouyu states practitioners of emei dapeng qigong believe yue trained under zhou as a child and competed to become china \\'s top fighter at an early age . their lineage story dictates zhou also took yue to a \" buddhist hermit \" who taught him said qigong style . northern praying mantis master yuen mankai says zhou taught yue the \" same school \" of martial arts as he did his water margin students and that the general was the originator of the praying mantis technique \" black tiger steeling [ sic ] heart \" . although martial arts historian stanley henning admits that yue \\'s biographies do not mention boxing , he says \" he [ yue ] almost certainly did practice some form of bare handed fighting \" to prepare for his weapons training . but he does not suggest who yue might have learned it from . \\n  = = = martial arts = = = \\n  there is insufficient historical evidence to support the claim he knew any skills beyond archery . contemporary records never once mention zhou teaching yue boxing . despite this , various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to zhou . these range from mastery of the bow , double swords and chinese spear to that of wudang hard qigong , chuojiao boxing and even x @-@ ray vision . wang shaotang \\'s folktale even represents him as a master of drunken eight immortals boxing . \\n  zhou can also be linked to these combat arts through his historical and folklore students . practitioners of eagle claw , chuojiao and xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with yue fei , the supposed progenitor of these styles . yuen mankai believes zhou taught lin chong and lu junyi the \" same school \" of martial arts that was later combined with seventeen other schools to create mantis fist . this combination of various schools refers to an eighteenth @-@ century martial arts manual that describes the gathering of eighteen masters at the shaolin monastery that supposedly took place during the early years of the song dynasty . lin chong and yan qing are listed as two of the eighteen masters invited , which means their skills of mandarin duck leg and ground fighting are treated as two separate schools , instead of one . but he believes mantis fist was created during the ming dynasty , and was therefore influenced by these eighteen schools from the song . he also says lu junyi taught yan qing the same martial arts as he learned from zhou . \\n  very few references are made to the people who supposedly taught martial arts to zhou . in the legend of zhou tong , he learns as a child from a shaolin master named tan zhengfang . practitioners of chuojiao claim he learned the style from its creator , a wandering taoist named deng liang . practitioners of geok gar kuen , a style attributed to yue fei , believe he studied under han de , a \" chivalrous person \" from shaanxi . \\n  = = in popular culture = = \\n  zhou has appeared in various kinds of media including novels , comic books , and movies . apart from the story of yue fei and iron arm , golden sabre , he appears in a novel based around his older martial arts brother , jin tai . a recent graphic novel of the story of yue fei , deletes all mythological elements from the storyline and presents it in a historical manner . instead of traveling from hebei to hubei to inspect land , zhou travels from shaanxi to kaifeng city in henan to visit an old friend who had been promoted to general . while en route to the capital city , zhou takes note of a great famine plaguing the peasantry and even hears stories of some people resorting to cannibalism . however , when he arrives in kaifeng , he sees the empire is wasting money on the construction of large imperial gardens , the court officials cai jing and wang pu have extravagant residencies , and hears that even eunuchs are rich because they are given high government posts . upon locating his friend , zhou is distressed to find him in stocks and shackles and being escorted to the farthest reaches of china by imperial guards . he later learns that the general had accidentally offended some court officials and was sentenced to permanent exile on some trumped up charges . apparently having little or no money , zhou decides to visit wang ming in hubei ( mistakenly called hebei ) and becomes the estate \\'s tutor . \\n  another noticeable difference in the storyline takes place when zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the abbot . instead of yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake , he stays with zhou and the abbot , while the other disciples go off to explore . zhou watches as the abbot tests yue \\'s strength by asking him to move an ornate three @-@ hundred pound copper stove dating from the han dynasty . the abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy . he goes on to tell yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the liao and western xia empires , but became a monk after the song agreed to become a vassal of each state . he later made a name for himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area . since he has no heir of his own , the abbot presents yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon . zhou kindly protests the gift at first , but allows yue to keep it out of friendship . \\n  a second graphic novelization drastically changes the storyline involving zhou . like the original , zhou becomes the tutor of the wang estate , but , when news of his arrival prompts rich families to send their sons to learn from him , he is forced to accept droves of these students on a trial basis . he eventually chooses his friends \\' sons as his indoor disciples and yue as his \" godchild \" . years later , he takes his now teenage students not to see the buddhist abbot , but to teach them military strategy out in the mountain wilderness . yue senses trouble after his martial brothers separate to explore the forest and rushes off to rescue them , only to be confronted by a monstrous snake . after vanquishing the beast with his sword , yue discovers a magic glowing spear within a cave and reports back to zhou . following their training , zhou becomes ill from overexposure to the cold mountain air on the return trip home and dies soon after . instead of just yue , all of his students live beside his grave for a mourning period of one hundred days before returning home to their families . these events take place three years before zhou originally died in the story of yue fei . \\n  stories including zhou have also been used to educate . the secondary school system of hong kong teaches children the value of mentorship by making them read about the close teacher @-@ pupil relationship between zhou and yue . a morale tale called \" yue fei studies archery \" in children \\'s pictorial , a chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven , demonstrates how great achievements are only made possible via diligent practice . the story states how young yue stumbles upon zhou \\'s training hall in a neighboring town while gathering fire wood . yue applies to become a student , but zhou tells him he must first practice the art of the \" far @-@ sighted person \" by staring into the morning sun to improve his eyesight . after years of unrelenting practice , yue is able to spot a lone goose flying off in the distance and two cicadas on a tree far into the forest . zhou then officially takes him as his disciple and adopted son . under his tutelage , yue is able to master the eighteen weapons of war and to shoot a falling leaf from one @-@ hundred paces away . \\n  he is mentioned numerous times in author robert liparulo \\'s thriller deadlock ( 2009 ) . zhou is first featured in chapter eight during a conversation between the main character john \" hutch \" hutchinson , a journalist bent on stopping the maniacal plans of a billionaire madman , and his friend \\'s young son dillon , an archery enthusiast . when hutch asks him if he had ever heard of the archery @-@ champion @-@ turned @-@ actor howard hill , dillon replies : \" i don \\'t think so ... you told me about zhou tong \" . hutch then says : \" oh , yeah . zhou tong was something . taught the song dynasty to be the best military archers in history . but howard hill [ was the best ] \" . later in chapter fifty , while hutch is trailing a killer through an airport , a page goes out over the intercom system for a \" mr. zhou tong \" . when the page goes out again , hutch muses : \" zhou tong had been a famous archery teacher and military arts tutor in the song dynasty . [ dillon and i ] had long telephone conversations about him , because of tong \\'s blending of archery skills and self @-@ discipline . he was an inspiration to [ me ] . dillon had sensed that and wanted to known everything about him \" . he finally realizes that the page had to have been left by dillon \\'s mother laura to catch his attention . the page is sent to warn him of a trap , but hutch receives it too late . \\n  screen actors who have portrayed zhou in film \\'s from the 1940s and 1960s include wong sau nin , li ming , and jing ci bo . jing starred alongside a ten @-@ year @-@ old sammo hung , who played young yue fei . veteran martial arts actor yu chenghui , who played the sword @-@ wielding antagonist in jet li \\'s shaolin temple , stated in a 2005 newspaper interview that he never shaved his trademark beard , even at the request of movie producers , because he wanted to portray zhou in a future film . he went on to say \" he is an outstandingly able person from the northern and southern song dynasties and many water margin heroes are his disciples . this person is very important in the martial arts and many people want to portray him in films \" . \\n  = romanian land forces = \\n  the romanian land forces ( romanian : forțele terestre române ) is the army of romania , and the main component of the romanian armed forces . in recent years , full professionalisation and a major equipment overhaul have transformed the nature of the force . \\n  the romanian land forces were founded on 24 november [ o.s. 12 november ] 1859 . they participated in world war i , together with the russian empire forces in actions against the central powers and , despite initial setbacks , won the decisive battles of mărăşti and mărăşeşti . during most of world war ii ( until august 23 , 1944 ) romanian forces supported the axis powers , fighting against the soviet union on the eastern front . from august 1944 until the end of the war , romania fought against germany under the control of the soviet union . when the communists seized power after the second world war , the army underwent reorganisation and sovietization . \\n  following the romanian revolution , due to shortage of funds , many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out . likewise , romanian military capability declined because of a lack of fuel as well as training . however , since the late 1990s , a number of positive changes have come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly ; since 1996 , the military budget has grown more than four times - rising from 636 million dollars to 2 @.@ 8 billion dollars in 2007 . conscription has been abolished and professionalisation has been completed . \\n  = = mission = = \\n  the land forces

under the command of general erich von falkenhayn stalled the attack in november , 1916 , and drove back the romanians . at the same time , austrian and turkish troops invaded southern romania , forcing the country into a two @-@ front war . the central powers drove deep into romania and conquered the south of the country ( wallachia , including bucharest ) by the end of 1916 . the romanian forces , led by marshal constantin prezan , retreated into the north @-@ east part of romania ( moldavia ) . in the summer of 1917 however , prezan , aided by the future marshal , general ion

second army in the victories of the battle of mărăşti ( july 22 to august 1 , 1917 ) and the battle of mărăşeşti ( august 6 to september 8 , 1917 ) . as a result of the russian revolution , romania was left isolated and unable to continue the war , and was forced to sign the treaty of bucharest with the central powers . later on , in 1919 , germany agreed , in the treaty of versailles article 259 , to renounce all the benefits provided to it by the treaty of bucharest in 1918 . after the successful offensive on the thessaloniki front , which put bulgaria out of the war , romania re @-@

general ( later marshal ) ion antonescu took power in september 1940 , romania signed the tripartite pact with the axis powers and subsequently took part in operation barbarossa in 1941 . an expeditionary force invaded the soviet union in bessarabia and southern ukraine , alongside the german wehrmacht . the expeditionary force , \\' army group antonescu , \\' was composed on 22 june 1941 of the 3rd army , the 4th army , the 2nd army corps , and the 11th infantry division . the 3rd army comprised the 4th army corps ( 6th and 7th infantry divisions ) , the cavalry corps , the mountain corps , two separate artillery battalion , a ta unit , and the air force \\'s 3rd army cooperation command . the 4th army consisted of the 3rd army corps , the 5th army corps , the 11th army corps ( two fortress brigades ) , and the 4th army cooperation command . the army group @-@ level 2nd army corps , under major general n. macici , controlled the 9th and 10th infantry divisions and the 7th cavalry brigade . additionally the 1st armoured division was formed for service on the eastern front . the army group \\'s first offensive , in conjunction with the eleventh army , operation munchen , enabled romania to retake the territory immediately east of the dnister , former part of moldavia . the romanian armies saw their first major battles at odessa and sevastopol , and in 1942 advanced with other axis forces deeper into soviet territory during operation blue . \\n  the greatest disaster for the romanian expeditionary force on the eastern front came at stalingrad , where , during the soviet counter @-@ offensive of november 1942 , the thinly spread forces of the third army ( deployed north of stalingrad ) and of the fourth army ( deployed south of stalingrad ) were attacked by vastly superior soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some 158 @,@ 000 personnel . \\n  during april – may 1944 the romanian forces led by general mihai racoviţǎ , together with elements of the german eighth army were responsible for defending northern romania during the soviet first jassy @-@ kishinev offensive , and took part in the battles of târgu frumos . in late august 1944 , the red army entered eastern romania . on august 23 , 1944 , a coup led by king michael i of romania deposed marshal antonescu and set up a pro @-@ soviet government . it has been estimated that the royal coup shortened the war for romania by six months . romania soon declared war on nazi germany , and the first and fourth armies were pressed into action . after the expelling of the last wehrmacht remnants from romania , the romanian armies took part in the siege of budapest and the prague offensive of may 1945 . \\n  = = = cold war = = = \\n  the soviet occupation of romania led to a complete reorganisation of the romanian land forces under the supervision of the red army . at the onset , pro @-@ german elements were purged from the romanian armed forces . in 1944 – 45 , two divisions were formed out of romanian volunteers — ex @-@ prisoners of war , trained and indoctrinated in the soviet union during the war , but also of many communist activists . one was the tudor vladimirescu first volunteer division , under the command of colonel nicolae cambrea , and the other the horia , cloşca şi crişan division , under the command of general mihail lascăr ( who later served as minister of defence from 1946 to 1947 ) . these two units formed the nucleus of the new romanian land forces under soviet control . the postwar reorganisation of the land forces included cavalry but the arm disappeared from the force with the disbandment in november 1954 of the 59th cavalry division at oradea . \\n  after the romanian communist party seized political power , the sovietization of the army commenced , under the supervision of the new minister of defence , emil bodnăraş . thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers ( mostly experienced soldiers , and a potential source of opposition ) were purged from the military . this involved copying the soviet model of military and political organisation , and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence , also in the context of romania \\'s integration in the strategic system of the soviets , at the beginning of the cold war . \\n  in the early 1950s the rlf reached a level of 12 rifle , one mechanised , and one tank division . between 1960 and 1964 the rifle and mechanised divisions were converted to motor rifle divisions , and reductions in strength began ; force size dropped to six motor rifle and two tank divisions by 1970 . from 1970 to 1976 , three more motor rifle divisions were formed , but one was deactivated in 1977 , and the eight motor rifle and three tank division figure remained that way for the rest of the cold war . \\n  from 1947 to 1960 the country seems to have been divided into three major military regions : cluj , bacău , and bucharest in the west , east , and south , respectively . in wartime the land forces in each military region would become an army corps with their headquarters in cluj @-@ napoca , iaşi , and bucharest . armies seem to have succeeded military regions in 1960 , and three armies seem to have become four in 1980 . what is known is that on 01 @.@ 07 @.@ 1947 fourth army became 3rd military region , based in cluj . the 3rd military region became the 3rd army on 30 april 1960 , and the 4th army on 5 april 1980 . \\n  during the 1980s , the land forces numbered 140 @,@ 000 personnel , of whom two thirds were conscripts . in 1989 four armies appeared to exist : the first army at bucharest , second army at buzau , third army at craiova , and fourth army at napoca . in 1989 the land forces consisted of eight mechanised ( infantry ) divisions ( 1st , bucharest , 2nd , craiova , 9th , constanta , 10th , iași , 11th , oradea , 18th , timişoara , 67th , and 81st , tirgu mureş ) two tank divisions ( the 57th tank division at bucharest and the 6th tank division at tirgu mureş ) , four mountain infantry brigades , and three airborne brigades . according to the 165 @-@ year \\' history of modern romanian artillery , \\' in 1989 the 1st army consisted of the 1st mech div , 57th tank div . , and the 2nd mountain brigade ; the 2nd army of the 9th mech div , 10th mech div , 67th mech div , and 32nd tactical rocket bde ; the 3rd army of the 2nd mech

motorised rifle divisions were organized along the soviet model with three motorised rifle regiments , one tank regiment , and a full complement of 12 @,@ 000 infantry soldiers . the artillery , antitank , and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver . the air defense regiments consisted of two anti @-@ aircraft artillery battalions and one surface @-@ to @-@ air missile ( sam ) battalion , each composed of several batteries . in the late 1980s the artillery regiments of motorised rifle and tank divisions included two artillery battalions , one multiple rocket launcher battalion , and one surface @-@ to @-@ surface missile battalion . \\n  surface @-@ to @-@ surface missile battalions were divided into three or four batteries , each equipped with one missile launcher . they operated thirty frog @-@ 3 and eighteen scud missile launchers . the frog @-@ 3 , a tactical missile first introduced in 1960 , was being replaced in other non @-@ soviet warsaw pact armies . proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat , frog and scud missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high @-@ explosive warheads . tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads , however , they could be devastating . according to one former romanian official writing in 1988 , romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles . \\n  = = = post @-@ communist era = = = \\n  during the early 1990s , some major units were disbanded and a lot of equipment was phased out or scrapped due to a severe shortage of funds . the whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps , and from regiments into battalions . in the mid @-@ 1990s , the situation of the land forces was critical : the military budget was three times lower than in 1989 ( 636 million dollars ) , 50 % of the equipment was older than 30 years , and 60 % of the armoured vehicles and 85 % of the missile units were non @-@ operational . due to lack of fuel and training , the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low ( only about 30 % of the entire land forces were operational ) . however , after 1996 the government took serious action ; the military budget was increased greatly , and modernisation of equipment commenced . officially , the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 april 2000 . \\n  = = present organisation = = \\n  = = = manpower = = = \\n  in 2005 , the army comprised eight combat , four combat support and two logistic brigades , while ten combat , five combat support and two logistic brigades could be further mobilised in case of crisis . many of these units have been

integration in nato and eu ) , while 2025 is the date when the long @-@ term stage is to be completed ( full technical integration in nato and eu ) . the stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces , reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with nato standards . \\n  romania abolished compulsory military service on october 23 , 2006 . this came about due to a 2003 constitutional amendment which allowed the parliament to make military service optional . the romanian parliament voted to abolish conscription in october 2005 , with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that romania agreed to when it joined nato in march 2004 . \\n  = = = structure = = = \\n  in peacetime , the commander of the land forces is the minister of defense , while in wartime , the president of romania becomes the supreme commander of the armed forces . the main combat formations of romania are the 2nd infantry division getica , and the 4th infantry division gemina . until 2015 the romanian land forces fielded a third division , namely the 1st division dacia . before june 2008 , the 1st and 4th divisions were known as the 1st territorial army corps and the 4th territorial army corps and in turn they used to be called the 1st army and 4th army prior to 2000 . however due to their personnel

paratrooper battalions and a logistic battalion . \\n  the most famous and well trained unit is the 1st special operations battalion \" vulturii \" , which was legally created in late 2005 , after several batches of graduates had already been selected . members of the special forces battalion have benefitted from courses abroad , such as the us army special forces ( green berets ) course , the united states marine corps force recon course , as well as other courses . the special forces battalion became fully operational during 2007 , after a company had already been commissioned in early

regime . after the revolution , the units suffered from a lack of funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the 313th battalion . however , their equipment was completely overhauled in the past few years and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength . \\n  dir , rapid intervention squad of the romanian ministry of defense is an elite special operations unit

track through the eastern caribbean sea during october , 2008 . forming out of a tropical disturbance on october 13 , omar initially moved slowly in the eastern caribbean sea . by october 15 , omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation . later that day , an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast . early on october 16 , omar reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @.@ 29 inhg ) . shortly after , the hurricane rapidly weakened to category 1 intensity . after slightly re @-@ strengthening the next day , omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non @-@ convective low pressure area . the remnants of omar persisted until october 21 at which time it dissipated to the west of the azores . \\n  throughout the eastern caribbean , omar affected numerous islands , most of which only recorded minor impacts . large swells and heavy rains impacted the abc islands . antigua and barbuda sustained $ 54 million in damages , mainly on antigua as nine homes were destroyed , several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters . one person died in puerto rico after suffering a stress @-@ induced cardiac arrest . the united states virgin islands also sustained significant damage , costing roughly $ 6 million . numerous boats and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were snapped . total losses from the storm were estimated at $ 79 million . \\n  = = meteorological history = = \\n  on september 30 , a well @-@ developed tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of africa and entered the atlantic ocean . deep convection formed around a prominent mid @-@ level circulation as it moved towards the west . however , the convection diminished on october 2 before entering the caribbean sea a week later . upon entering the caribbean sea , shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low . continued development followed and the low was designated as tropical depression fifteen at 0600 utc on october 13 while located about 190 miles ( 305 kilometres ) south of the southeastern tip of the dominican republic . the previous steady westward motion that the system took across the atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two . as the structure of the storm improved , it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the national hurricane center ( nhc ) gave it the name omar . \\n  located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid @-@ level ridge , omar took a counter @-@ clockwise turn on october 14 . upon becoming a tropical storm , omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation . wind shear around the storm , which was previously inhibiting quick development , weakened , allowing for further strengthening . later that day , an 11 @.@ 5 to 17 @.@ 2 mi ( 18 @.@ 5 to 27 @.@ 7 km ) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough . with the formation of an eye , the dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , signifying that omar had intensified into a hurricane . the intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical . however , deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared puerto rico . shortly after , the eye quickly became well @-@ defined and appeared on visible satellite images , an indication the storm was intensifying . the chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well @-@ developed outflow and prominent banding features . \\n  with very warm sea surface temperatures , high ocean heat content , low wind shear , and a moist air mass , omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on october 16 as a category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) . during the intensification phase , the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) . once in the atlantic ocean , omar began to rapidly weaken , with winds decreasing by 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) in 12 hours . visible satellite images depicted an exposed low @-@ level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air . by october 17 , most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated ; however , a brief decrease in wind shear allowed omar to re @-@ strengthen to its secondary peak , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . during this phase , convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed . later that day , the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed omar , leading to decreasing movement . \\n  a weakening storm , omar continued towards the northeast due to a mid to upper @-@ level ridge located south of the system and the mid @-@ latitude westerlies to the north . late on october 17 , wind shear increased once more as omar tracked over waters below 26 ° c ( 79 ° f ) . around 0000 utc on october 18 , omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated . twelve hours later , while still producing tropical storm @-@ force winds ,

general suppression of the society of jesus . the various courts under the house of bourbon and the kingdom of portugal ( under the house of braganza ) had exerted strong pressure on the holy see to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate . in 1759 jesuits were expelled from portugal , in 1762 from the kingdom of france , in 1767 from spain and in 1768 from the kingdom of naples , the kingdom of sicily and the duchy of parma and piacenza . clement xiii strongly defended the society ( e.g. in the bull apostolicum pascendi in 1765 ) , but without success . in january 1769 france and naples seized the papal territories around avignon , benevento and pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order . the sudden death of 75 @-@ year @-@

1769 was almost completely dominated by the problem of the society of jesus . the sacred college of cardinals was divided into two blocs : pro @-@ jesuits and anti @-@ jesuits , but several cardinals were neutral . the pro @-@ jesuit faction , called zelanti , grouped italian curial cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the church . their leaders were gian francesco and alessandro albani and cardinal @-@ nephew of the deceased pope carlo rezzonico . the anti @-@ jesuit bloc ( called also \" court faction \" ) grouped crown @-@ cardinals of the catholic powers : france , spain and naples . respectively ruled at the time by louis xv of france , charles iii of spain and ferdinand iii of sicily / ferdinand iv of naples . in spite of the national divisions they worked together for the main goal – suppression of the society of jesus . the bourbon courts had decided to put the official leadership of this bloc in the hands of the french cardinal de bernis . he and his colleagues were instructed to block every pro @-@ jesuit candidature , even with the official exclusion if necessary . several cardinals , among them lorenzo ganganelli , did not belong to either faction . \\n  the spanish and neapolitan governments had classified forty three italian cardinals into five categories : \" good \" ( eleven cardinals ) , \" indifferent \" ( eight ) , \" doubtful \" ( three ) , \" bad \" ( fifteen ) and \" very bad \" ( six ) : \\n  cardinal orsini , the official representative of the neapolitan court , and all the foreigners , were not classified because it was certain that none of them would be ever elected pope . \\n  the french government was more fastidious than spanish and neapolitan . only three cardinals were considered good candidates : conti , durini and ganganelli \\n  out of these 43 cardinals only 27 or 28 were actually considered papabile , while the remaining 15 were excluded due to their age or health . \\n  = = conclave = = \\n  the conclave began on february 15 , 1769 . initially only 27 cardinals participated . zelanti , taking advantage of the small number of the electors and the absence of the french and spanish cardinals , tried to achieve a quick election of cardinal flavio chigi . in one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected . the efforts of zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of france and spain , but , fortunately for them , cardinal orsini , protector of the kingdom of naples and the only crown @-@ cardinal present in the early ballots , was able to join some neutral cardinals to block chigi ’ s candidature . \\n  an unprecedented event was the visit of joseph ii , holy roman emperor , who arrived incognito in rome on march 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave . he stayed there two weeks , freely debating with the electors . fortunately , he did not press them but only expressed the wish for the election of a pope who would be able to carry out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers . \\n  cardinal de bernis entered the conclave at the end of march and took the leadership of the anti @-@ jesuit faction from the hands of cardinal orsini , who could have blocked zelanti ’ s actions only with the great difficulties . bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with french ambassador marquis d \\'aubeterre , which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave . ambassadors of france and spain urged bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the jesuits . bernis refused , answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the society of jesus would be in violation of the canon law . in spite of this refusal , during the next few weeks bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by zelanti as too devoted to the jesuits . in this way twenty @-@ three out of twenty @-@ eight papabile were eliminated , among them strongly pro @-@ jesuit cardinal fantuzzi , who at some point was very close to achieving election to the papal throne , as well as cavalchini , colonna , stoppani , pozzobonelli , sersale , and several others . \\n  the arrival of spanish cardinals solis and de la cerda on april 27 strengthened the anti @-@ jesuit party . they also violated the law of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with spanish ambassador azpuru . the spaniards had fewer scruples than bernis and , supported by cardinal malvezzi , took the matter into their own hands . they paid attention to the only friar in the sacred college , cardinal lorenzo ganganelli , o.f.m.conv. the attitude of ganganelli towards the jesuits was a great mystery – he had been educated by the jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of father lorenzo ricci , general of the society of jesus , but during the pontificate of clement xiii he did not engage himself in the defence of the order . cardinal solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election . ganganelli answered that \" he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish , with good conscience , the society of jesus , provided he observed the canon law ; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the crowns \" . it is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise , but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors . \\n  in the same time zelanti , also began to incline to give their support to ganganelli , looking upon him as indifferent or even favourable to the jesuits . it seems that the attitude of zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders alessandro and gian francesco albani and the spanish cardinals . cardinal de bernis , the nominal leader of the court faction , probably did not play any role in the appointment of ganganelli and only followed the instructions of marquis d \\'aubeterre when all had been already known . \\n  = = = results of the ballots = = = \\n  the results of the

hendford cricket ground was a first @-@ class cricket ground located in yeovil , somerset . the land for the ground was first leased by yeovil cricket club in 1874 , and was also used for a range of other sports , most significantly hosting yeovil rugby club in the 1890s , and then again from 1935 until the ground was closed . significant improvements were made to the ground during the 1930s , including the opening of a new pavilion , jointly funded by the rugby and cricket clubs . the ground was demolished in 1944 when westland aircraft extended their factory , and both yeovil cricket club and rugby club moved to johnson park . \\n  between 1935 and 1939 , the ground hosted five annual somerset county cricket club matches in july or august ; the first of which nearly broke a county record for ticket sales on the gate . somerset only won one of the five matches , the 1936 contest against worcestershire . \\n  = = history = = \\n  yeovil and county cricket club was formed in 1865 , and was the first attempt at setting up a county cricket team for somerset . the attempt was unsuccessful , and the club broke up . in 1874 , the club was re @-@ formed with the lesser remit , as yeovil cricket club . as part of the club \\'s resuscitation , the committee purchased the use of a field in west hendford in yeovil , from a local farmer , mr brook . the field , part of key farm , was leased for £ 10 . there is record of a match being played on the ground the following year between two sets of members of the yeovil cricket club . during the late 19th @-@ century , the ground was used for other sports as well as cricket ; it had a grass athletics track , and also hosted yeovil football club , who at the time played both association and rugby football . the football club played at west hendford on an irregular basis during the late 19th @-@ century , but returned in 1935 , by which time they only played rugby , and had changed their name accordingly to yeovil rugby club . in 1895 , the cricket club committee announced that there was provision for a longer lease , of five or seven years , and that they would make improvements to the ground to enable it to host first @-@ class cricket . the ground was also used for field hockey in the early 20th @-@ century , hosting a yeovil hockey club . \\n  somerset county cricket club played their first of five annual first @-@ class matches on the ground in 1935 . the match , against surrey , was a significant event in the town , and a series of festivities were arranged to run alongside the three @-@ day contest , including a dance and a smoking concert . entry for the match , which took place from 17 to 19 august was one shilling , and attracted over 5 @,@ 000 people , raising around £ 400 . surrey won the match by eight wickets . the takings from this match helped the yeovil cricket club make further improvements to the ground , expanding it and adding further seating . the following year , somerset played worcestershire at the ground , in what the western gazette described as \" yeovil cricket festival \" . the captain of yeovil cricket club , richard southcombe , was included in the somerset team , which won the match by 170 runs . the takings were slightly lower than the previous year due to poor weather , but still described as \" gratifying \" . \\n  in 1937 , sussex beat somerset at the ground , in a match that once again drew a crowd of around 5 @,@ 000 . the yorkshire evening post described the wicket as \" crumbling \" towards the end of the match , favouring the bowlers . in 1938 hampshire visited , and the report in the western daily press lamented the state of the wicket , which meant that the game , like the three first @-@ class matches at the ground before it , was completed in two days , rather than the scheduled three . that winter , a new pavilion costing £ 550 was erected on the ground for the shared use of the cricket club and the rugby club . the final first @-@ class match on the ground was played in july 1939 against lancashire , but torrential rain limited the match to only three hours of play . the takings for the full three days of the match were only £ 87 , and the taunton courier estimated that the losses for the match could be hundreds of pounds . despite the weather , almost 2 @,@ 000 people attended the match , and the taunton courier report praised the alterations that had been made to the ground ; the removal of a hedge made the ground lighter , while the ground itself had been well looked after , and drained quickly . the second world war suspended the county championship from 1940 to 1945 , and during that time , westland aircraft took over the ground to expand their factory , and informed yeovil cricket club that it was no longer available , forcing them to search for a new ground in 1946 . they eventually relocated to the newly opened johnson park in 1948 . the rugby club also moved to johnson park , amalgamating itself into yeovil sports club . after a short break , somerset county cricket club returned to yeovil , playing fourteen fixtures at johnson park between 1951 and 1970 , and eight matches at westlands sports ground from 1971 to 1978 . \\n  = = records = = \\n  during its limited use as a first @-@ class cricket ground , only one century was scored on the ground , by jim parks .

world war z = \\n  world war z : an oral history of the zombie war ( 2006 ) is an apocalyptic horror novel by max brooks . the novel is a collection of individual accounts narrated by an agent of the united nations postwar commission , following the devastating global conflict against the zombie plague . other passages record a decade @-@ long desperate struggle , as experienced by people of various nationalities . the personal accounts also describe the resulting social , political , religious , and environmental changes . \\n  world war z is a follow @-@ up to brooks \\' \" survival manual \" the zombie survival guide ( 2003 ) , but its tone is much more serious . it was inspired by the good war : an oral history of world war two ( 1984 ) by studs terkel , and by the zombie films of george a. romero . brooks used world war z to comment on government ineptitude and american isolationism , while also examining survivalism and uncertainty . the novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics . \\n  its audiobook version , performed by a full cast including alan alda , mark hamill , and john turturro , won an audie award in 2007 . a film inspired by the novel , directed by marc forster and starring brad pitt , was released in 2013 . \\n  = = plot = = \\n  the story is told in the form of a series of interviews conducted by the narrator , max brooks , an agent of the united nations postwar commission . although the exact origin of the plague is unknown , a young boy from a village in china is identified as the plague \\'s official patient zero . the boy \\'s case marks the point where the chinese government begins to take measures to cover up the disease , including generating a crisis with taiwan to mask their activities . nevertheless , the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking , refugees and the black market organ trade . initially , these nations were able to cover up their smaller outbreaks , until a much larger outbreak in south africa brings the plague to public attention . \\n  as the infection spreads , israel abandons the palestinian territories and initiates a nationwide quarantine , closing its borders to everyone except uninfected jews and palestinians . its military then puts down an ultra @-@ orthodox uprising , which is later referred to as an israeli civil war . the united states does little to prepare because it is overconfident in its ability to suppress any threat . although special forces teams contain initial outbreaks , a widespread effort never starts : the nation is deprived of political will by \" brushfire wars \" , and a widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine creates a false sense of security . \\n  as many more areas around the globe fall to infection , a period known as the \" great panic \" begins . pakistan and iran destroy each other in a nuclear war , after the iranian government attempts to stem the flow of refugees fleeing through pakistan into iran . after zombies overrun new york city , the u.s. military sets up a high @-@ profile defense in the nearby city of yonkers . the \" battle of yonkers \" is a disaster ; modern weapons and tactics prove ineffective against zombies , as the enemy has no self @-@ preservation instincts and can only be stopped if shot through the head . the unprepared and demoralized soldiers are routed on live television . other countries suffer similarly disastrous defeats , and human civilization teeters on the brink of destruction . \\n  in south africa , the government adopts a contingency plan drafted by apartheid @-@ era intelligence consultant paul redeker . it calls for the establishment of small sanctuaries , leaving large groups of survivors abandoned in special zones in order to distract the undead and allowing those within the main safe zone time to regroup and recuperate . governments worldwide assume similar plans or relocate the populace to safer foreign territory , such as the attempted complete evacuation of the japanese archipelago to kamchatka . because zombies freeze solid in severe cold , many civilians in north america flee to the wildernesses of northern canada and the arctic , where eleven million people die of starvation and hypothermia . it is implied that some turn to cannibalism to survive ; further interviews from other sources imply that cannibalism occurred in areas of the united states where food shortages occurred . the three remaining astronauts in the international space station survive the war by salvaging supplies from the abandoned chinese space station and maintain some military and civilian satellites using an orbital fuel station . a surviving member of the iss crew describes \" mega \" swarms of zombies on the american great plains and central asia , and how the crisis affected earth \\'s atmosphere . \\n  the u.s. eventually establishes safe zones west of the rocky mountains and spends much of the next decade eradicating zombies in that region . all aspects of civilian life are devoted to supporting the war effort against the pandemic . much of it resembles total war strategies : rationing of fuel and food , cultivation of private gardens , and civilian neighborhood patrols . the u.s. government also initiates a \" re @-@ education act \" to train the civilian population for the war effort and restore order ; the people with skills such as carpentry and construction find themselves more valuable than people with managerial skills . \\n  seven years after the outbreak began , a conference is held off the coast of honolulu , aboard the uss saratoga , where most of the world \\'s leaders argue that they can outlast the zombie plague if they stay in their safe zones . the u.s. president , however , argues for going on the offensive . determined to lead by example , the u.s. military reinvents itself to meet the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead : using semi @-@ automatic , high @-@ power rifles and volley firing , focusing on head shots and slow , steady rates of fire ( a tactic \" re @-@ invented \" by the indian army during the great panic ) ; and devising a multipurpose hand tool , the \" lobotomizer \" or \" lobo \" ( described as a combination of a shovel and a battle axe ) , for close @-@ quarters combat . the military , backed by a resurgent american wartime economy , began the three @-@ year @-@ long process of retaking the contiguous united states from both the undead as well as groups of hostile human survivors . prewar military tactics and equipment are mentioned as being employed to deal with sometimes well @-@ armed and organized human criminal or rebel opposition . \\n  ten years after the official end of the zombie war , millions of zombies are still active , mainly on the ocean floor or on snow line islands . a democratic cuba has become the world \\'s most thriving economy . following a civil war that saw use of nuclear weapons , china has become a democracy and is now known as the \" chinese federation \" . tibet is freed from chinese rule and hosts lhasa , the world \\'s most populated city . following a religious revolution and the revival of russian orthodoxy , russia is now an expansionist theocracy known as the holy russian empire . owing to the fact that many young russians either became zombies , were infected with hiv , or died due to drugs , the government has initiated a \" breeding \" program , with the remaining fertile women implied to be coercively impregnated to raise the birthrate . north korea is completely empty , with the entire population presumed to have disappeared into underground bunkers . \\n  the situation in the british isles is not entirely clear in the novel , although ireland may have escaped the worst of the outbreak . members of the british royal family had fled to ireland and the isle of man , following the military retreat to the antonine wall , and now exports oil from a reserve under windsor castle where the queen held out for the war \\'s duration , refusing to flee with her relatives . the papacy established a wartime refuge in the roman catholic archdiocese of armagh . in france , the palace of versailles was the site of a massacre and has been burned to the ground ; military losses were particularly high while clearing the catacombs underneath paris because the catacombs housed nearly a quarter of a million refugees during the early stages of the war , all of whom became zombies . iceland has been completely depopulated and remains the world \\'s most heavily infested country . \\n  the israelis and palestinians have made peace , and the former occupied territories have been renamed \" unified palestine \" . mexico is now known as \" aztlán \" . several countries are described as having revised borders due to the \" dumping \" of convicts into infected zones ; these convicts rose to command \" powerful fiefdoms \" that later became independent states . a so @-@ called \" pacific continent \" appears to encompass previously uninhabited islands as well as ships rendered immobile due to lack of fuel . for unknown reasons , the saudi royal family destroyed the oil fields in saudi arabia . \\n  the united nations fields a large military force to eliminate the remaining zombies from overrun areas , defeat hordes that surface from the ocean floor , and kill frozen zombies before they unfreeze . it is stated that previously eradicated diseases have made a comeback and that global life expectancy is greatly reduced as the world starts over from where it began . \\n  = = development = = \\n  brooks designed world war z to follow the \" laws \" set up in his earlier work , the zombie survival guide ( 2003 ) , and explained that the guide may exist in the novel \\'s fictional universe . the zombies of the zombie survival guide are human bodies reanimated by an incurable virus ( solanum ) , devoid of intelligence , desirous solely of consuming living flesh , and cannot be killed unless the brain is destroyed . decomposition will eventually set in , but this process takes longer than for an uninfected body and can be slowed by effects such as freezing . although zombies do not tire and are as strong as the humans they infect , they are slow @-@ moving and incapable of planning or cooperation in their attacks . zombies usually reveal their presence by moaning . \\n  brooks discussed the cultural influences on the novel . he claimed inspiration from \" the good war \" : an oral history of world war two ( 1984 ) by studs terkel , stating : \" [ terkel \\'s book is ] an oral history of world war ii . i read it when i was a teenager and it \\'s sat with me ever since . when i sat down to write world war z : an oral history of the zombie war , i wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history . \" brooks also cited renowned zombie film director george a. romero as an influence and criticized the return of the living dead films : \" they cheapen zombies , make them silly and campy . they \\'ve done for the living dead what the old batman tv show did for the dark knight . \" brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel , including one to alien robot franchise transformers , but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently . \\n  brooks conducted copious research while writing world war z. the technology , politics , economics , culture , and military tactics were based on a variety of reference books and consultations with expert sources . brooks also cites the u.s. army as a reference on firearm statistics . \\n  = = analysis = = \\n  = = = social commentary = = = \\n  reviewers have noted that brooks uses world war z as a platform to criticize government ineptitude , corporate corruption , and human short @-@ sightedness . at one point in the book , a palestinian refugee living in kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising , fearing it is a trick by israel . many american characters blame the united states \\' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the middle east . \\n  brooks shows his particular dislike of government bureaucracy . for example , one character in the novel tries to justify lying about the zombie outbreak to avoid widespread panic , while at the same time failing to develop a solution for fear of arousing public ire . he has also criticized american isolationism : \\n  = = = themes = = = \\n  = = = = survivalism = = = = \\n  survivalism and disaster preparation are prevalent themes in the novel . several interviews , especially those from the united states , focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving americans to fight the zombies and rebuild the country . for example , when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies , the plumber could hold a higher status than the former c.e.o. ; when the ultra @-@ rich hid in their homes , which had been turned into fortified compounds , they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in , leading to mass slaughter . throughout the novel , characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster . brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak . he also pointed out that americans like the zombie genre because they believe they can survive anything with the right tools and talent . \\n  = = = = fear and uncertainty = = = = \\n  brooks considers the theme of uncertainty central to the zombie genre . he believes that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world . brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies : \\n  this mindlessness is connected to the context in which brooks was writing . he declared : \" at this point we \\'re pretty much living in an irrational time \" , full of human suffering and lacking reason or logic . when asked in a subsequent interview about how he would compare terrorists with zombies , brooks said : \\n  = = reception = = \\n  reviews for the novel have been generally positive . gilbert cruz of entertainment weekly gave the novel an \" a \" rating , commenting that the novel shared with great zombie stories the use of a central metaphor , describing it as \" an addictively readable oral history . \" steven h. silver identified brooks \\' international focus as the novel \\'s greatest strength and commented favorably on brooks \\' ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak . silver \\'s only complaint was with \" good @-@ byes \" — the final chapter — in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement . silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry , undifferentiated characters were . the eagle described the book as being \" unlike any other zombie tale \" as it is \" sufficiently terrifying for most readers , and not always in a blood @-@ and @-@ guts way , either . \" keith phipps of the a.v. club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum , but found the novel \\'s individual episodes gripping . patrick daily of the chicago reader said the novel transcends the \" silliness \" of the zombie survival guide by \" touching on deeper , more somber aspects of the human condition . \" in his review for time out chicago , pete coco declared that \" [ b ] ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself . doing so in the mode of studs terkel might constitute brilliance . \" \\n  ron currie jr. named world war z one of his favorite apocalyptic novels and praised brooks for illustrating \" the tacit agreement between writer and reader that is essential to the success of stories about the end of the world ... [ both ] agree to pretend that this is not fiction , that in fact the horrific tales of a war between humans and zombies are based in reality . \" drew taylor of the fairfield county weekly credited world war z with making zombies more popular in mainstream society . \\n  the hardcover version of world war z spent four weeks on the new york times best seller list , peaking at number nine . by

it is a matter of typographical convention . since the introduction of movable @-@ type printing in europe , various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a latin alphabet . these include a normal word space ( as between the words in a sentence ) , a single enlarged space , and two full spaces . \\n  until the 20th century , publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences . there were exceptions to this traditional spacing method — some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing . this was french spacing — a term synonymous with single @-@ space sentence spacing until the late 20th century . with the introduction of the typewriter in the late 19th century , typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters . while wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid @-@ twentieth century , the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers . perhaps because of this , many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter . \\n  the desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated but many sources now say additional space is not necessary or desirable . from around 1950 , single sentence spacing became standard in books , magazines and newspapers and the majority of style guides that use a latin @-@ derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence . however , some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable . the debate continues on the world wide web . many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type . there is a debate on which convention is more readable ; the few recent direct studies conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results . \\n  = = history = = \\n  = = = traditional typesetting = = = \\n  shortly after the invention of movable type , highly variable spacing was created that could create spaces of any size , and allowed for perfectly even justification . early american , english , and other european typesetters \\' style guides ( also known as printers \\' rules ) specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards . these guides — e.g. , jacobi in the uk ( 1890 ) and mackellar , harpel , and de vinne ( 1866 – 1901 ) in the u.s. — indicated that sentences should be em @-@ spaced , and that words should be 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 em @-@ spaced ( illustration right ) . the relative size of the sentence spacing would vary depending on the size of the word spaces and the justification needs . for most countries , this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century . yet , even in this period , there were publishing houses ( notably in france ) that used a standard word space between sentences — a technique called french spacing ( illustration below ) . \\n  = = = mechanical type and the advent of the typewriter = = = \\n  mechanical type systems introduced near the end of the 19th century , such as the linotype and monotype machines , allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition . just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text , the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents . but the typewriters \\' mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing — typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the space bar . typists in some english @-@ speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing , but later settled on two spaces , a practice that continued throughout the 20th century . this became known as english spacing , and marked a divergence from french typists , who continued to use french spacing . \\n  = = = transition to single spacing = = = \\n  in the early 20th century , some printers began using one and a half interword spaces ( an \" en quad \" ) to separate sentences . this standard continued in use , to some extent , into the 1990s . \\n  magazines , newspapers , and books began to adopt the single space convention in the united states in the 1940s and in the united kingdom in the 1950s . typists did not move to single spacing simultaneously . the average writer still relied on the typewriter to create text — with its inherent mechanical spacing limitations . \\n  technological advances began affecting sentence spacing methods . in 1941 , ibm introduced the executive , a typewriter capable of proportional spacing — which had been used in professional typesetting for hundreds of years . this innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter — reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations . by the 1960s , electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text . this was also true of the world wide web , as html normally ignores additional spacing , although in 2011 the css 2 @.@ 1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces . in the 1980s , desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools . by the late 20th century , literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing . \\n  = = modern literature = = \\n  = = = typography = = = \\n  early positions on typography ( the \" arrangement and appearance of text \" ) supported traditional spacing techniques in english publications . in 1954 , geoffrey dowding \\'s book , finer points in the spacing and arrangement of type , underscored the widespread shift from a single enlarged em space to a standard word space between sentences . \\n  with the advent of the computer age , typographers began deprecating double spacing , even in monospaced text . in 1989 , desktop publishing by design stated that \" typesetting requires only one space after periods , question marks , exclamation points , and colons \" , and identified single sentence spacing as a typographic convention . stop stealing sheep & find out how type works ( 1993 ) and designing with type : the essential guide to typography ( 2006 ) both indicate that uniform spacing should be used between words , including between sentences . \\n  more recent works on typography weigh in strongly . ilene strizver , founder of the type studio , says , \" forget about tolerating differences of opinion : typographically speaking , typing two spaces before the start of a new sentence is absolutely , unequivocally wrong . \" the complete manual on typography ( 2003 ) states that \" the typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting \" and the single space is \" standard typographic practice \" . the elements of typographic style ( 2004 ) advocates a single space between sentences , noting that \" your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint [ double spacing ] victorian habit . \" \\n  david jury \\'s book , about face : reviving the rules of typography ( 2004 ) — published in switzerland — clarifies the contemporary typographic position on sentence spacing : \\n  word spaces , preceding or following punctuation , should be optically adjusted to appear to be of the same value as a standard word space . if a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma , then , optically , this produces a space of up to 50 % wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type . this is because these punctuation marks carry space above them , which , when added to the adjacent standard word spaces , combines to create a visually larger space . some argue that the \" additional \" space after a comma and full point serves as a \" pause signal \" for the reader . but this is unnecessary ( and visually disruptive ) since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself . \\n  = = = style and language guides = = = \\n  = = = = style guides = = = = \\n  early style guides for typesetting used a wider space between sentences than between words – \" traditional spacing \" , as shown in the illustration to the right . during the 20th century , style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts , which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work . as computer desktop publishing became commonplace , typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products . in the same period , style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing . the 1969 edition of the chicago manual of style used em spaces between sentences in its text ; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print . by the 1980s , the united kingdom \\'s hart \\'s rules ( 1983 ) had shifted to single sentence spacing . other style guides followed suit in the 1990s . soon after the beginning of the 21st century , the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences . \\n  modern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language . these works are important to writers since \" virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication . \" late editions of comprehensive style guides , such as the oxford style manual ( 2003 ) in the united kingdom and the chicago manual of style ( 2010 ) in the united states , provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics , including sentence spacing . the majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications . a few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work , and the gregg reference manual makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences . web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic , as \" html refuses to recognize double spaces altogether . \" these works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing . \\n  the european union \\'s interinstitutional style guide ( 2008 ) indicates that single sentence spacing is to be used in all european union publications — encompassing 23 languages . for the english language , the european commission \\'s english style guide ( 2010 ) states that sentences are always single @-@ spaced . the style manual : for authors , editors and printers ( 2007 ) , first published in 1966 by the commonwealth government printing office of australia , stipulates that only one space is used after \" sentence @-@ closing punctuation \" and that \" programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated , variable spacing , so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page . \" \\n  national languages not covered by an authoritative language academy typically have multiple style guides — only some of which may discuss sentence spacing . this is the case in the united kingdom . the oxford style manual ( 2003 ) and the modern humanities research association \\'s mhra style guide ( 2002 ) state that only single spacing should be used . in canada , both the english and french language sections of the canadian style , a guide to writing and editing ( 1997 ) , prescribe single sentence spacing . in the united states , many style guides — such as the chicago manual of style ( 2003 ) — allow only single sentence spacing . the most important style guide in italy , il nuovo manuale di stile ( 2009 ) , does not address sentence spacing , but the guida di stile italiano ( 2010 ) , the official guide for microsoft translation , tells users to use single sentence spacing \" instead of the double spacing used in the united states \" . \\n  = = = = language guides = = = = \\n  some languages , such as french and spanish , have academies that set language rules . their publications typically address orthography and grammar as opposed to matters of typography . style guides are less relevant for such languages , as their academies set prescriptive rules . for example , the académie française publishes the dictionnaire de l \\'académie française for french speakers worldwide . the 1992 edition does not provide guidance on sentence spacing , but is single @-@ sentence @-@ spaced throughout — consistent with historical french spacing . the spanish language is similar . the most important body within the association of spanish language academies , the real academia española , publishes the diccionario de la lengua española , which is viewed as prescriptive for the spanish language worldwide . the 2001 edition does not provide sentence spacing guidance , but is itself single sentence spaced . the german language manual empfehlungen des rats für deutsche rechtschreibung ( \" recommendations of the council for german orthography \" ) ( 2006 ) does not address sentence spacing . the manual itself uses one space after terminal punctuation . additionally , the duden , the german language dictionary most commonly used in germany , indicates that double sentence spacing is an error . \\n  = = = grammar guides = = = \\n  a few reference grammars address sentence spacing , as increased spacing between words is punctuation in itself . most do not . grammar guides typically cover terminal punctuation and the proper construction of sentences — but not the spacing between sentences . moreover , many modern grammar guides are designed for quick reference and refer users to comprehensive style guides for additional matters of writing style . for example , the pocket idiot \\'s guide to grammar and punctuation ( 2005 ) points users to style guides such as the mla style manual for consistency in formatting work and for all other \" editorial concerns \" . the grammar bible ( 2004 ) states that \" the modern system of english punctuation is by no means simple . a book that covers all the bases would need to be of considerable breadth and weight and anyone interested in such a resource is advised to consult the chicago manual of style . \" \\n  = = digital age = = \\n  in the computer era , spacing between sentences is handled in several different ways by various software packages . some systems accept whatever the user types , while others attempt to alter the spacing , or use the user input as a method of detecting sentences . computer @-@ based word processors , and typesetting software such as troff and tex , allow users to arrange text in a manner previously only available to professional typesetters . \\n  the text editing environment in emacs uses a double space following a period to identify the end of sentences unambiguously ; the double space convention prevents confusion with periods within sentences that signify abbreviations . how emacs recognizes the end of a sentence is controlled by the settings sentence @-@ end @-@ double @-@ space and sentence @-@ end . the vi editor also follows this convention ; thus , it is relatively easy to manipulate ( jump over , copy , delete ) whole sentences in both emacs and vi . \\n  the unix typesetter program troff uses two spaces to mark the end of a sentence . this allows the typesetter to distinguish sentence endings from abbreviations and to typeset them differently . early versions of troff , which only typeset in fixed width fonts , would automatically add a second space between sentences , which were detected based on the combination of terminal punctuation and a line feed . \\n  microsoft word does not treat sentences differently by default , but the grammar checking can be set to prefer a specific number of spaces between sentences . \\n  on some modern touch @-@ screen platforms , including android and ios , typing two spaces in a row is automatically interpreted to mean the end of a sentence , and a period is automatically inserted . however , only one space is retained . \\n  multiple spaces are eliminated by default in most world wide web content , regardless of whether they are associated with sentences or not . there are options for preserving spacing , such as the css white @-@ space property , and the < pre > tag . twitter retains extra spaces in user input on their website . html also includes several

= = \\n  james felici , author of the complete manual of typography , says that the topic of sentence spacing is \" the debate that refuses to die ... in all my years of writing about type , it \\'s still the question i hear most often , and a search of the web will find threads galore on the subject \" . this subject is still widely debated today . \\n  many people are opposed to single sentence spacing for various reasons . some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change . others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text . proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double @-@ spaced manuscript submissions from authors . a key example noted is the screenwriting industry \\'s monospaced standard for screenplay manuscripts , courier , 12 @-@ point font , although some works on screenwriting indicate that courier is merely preferred – proportional fonts may be used . some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide , but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers \\' guidance takes precedence , including those that ask for double sentence spaced manuscripts . \\n  one of the most popular arguments against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the typewriter , and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts . however , proportional fonts existed together with wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter , and remained for decades after its invention . when the typewriter was first introduced , typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences . this gradually shifted to two spaces , while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em @-@ spaced sentences . some sources now state it is acceptable for monospaced fonts to be single spaced today , although other references continue to specify double spacing for monospaced fonts . the double space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes , and that remains the practice in many cases . some voice concerns that students will later be forced to relearn how to type . \\n  most style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today , and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication — single sentence spaced . writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts , although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication . \\n  = = effects on readability and legibility = = \\n  claims abound regarding the legibility and readability of the single and double sentence spacing methods — by proponents on both sides . supporters of single spacing assert that familiarity with the current standard in books , magazines , and the web enhances readability , that double spacing looks strange in text using proportional fonts , and that the \" rivers \" and \" holes \" caused by double spacing impair readability . proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible , particularly noting the very small visual difference between a dot and a comma . \\n  however , typographic opinions are typically anecdotal with no basis in evidence . \" opinions are not always safe guides to legibility of print \" , and when direct studies are conducted , anecdotal opinions — even those of experts — can turn out to be false . text that seems legible ( visually pleasing at first glance ) may be shown to actually impair reading effectiveness when subjected to scientific study . \\n  = = = studies = = = \\n  direct studies on sentence spacing include those by loh , branch , shewanown , and ali ( 2002 ) ; clinton , branch , holschuh , and shewanown ( 2003 ) ; and ni , branch , and chen ( 2004 ) , with results favoring neither single , double , nor triple spacing . the 2002 study tested participants \\' reading speed for single and double sentence spaced passages of on @-@ screen text . the authors stated that \" the \\' double space group \\' consistently took longer time to finish than the \\' single space \\' group \" but concluded that \" there was not enough evidence to suggest that a significant difference exists . \" the 2003 and 2004 studies analyzed on @-@ screen single , double , and triple spacing . in both cases , the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion . ni , branch , chen , and clinton conducted a similar study in 2009 using identical spacing variables . the authors concluded that the \" results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences \" . \\n  = the crab with the golden claws = \\n  the crab with the golden claws ( french : le crabe aux pinces d \\'or ) is the ninth volume of the adventures of tintin , the comics series by belgian cartoonist hergé . the story was serialised weekly in le soir jeunesse , the children \\'s supplement to le soir , belgium \\'s leading francophone newspaper , from october 1940 to october 1941 amidst the german occupation of belgium during world war ii . partway through serialisation , le soir jeunesse was cancelled and the story began to be serialised daily in the pages of le soir . the story tells of young belgian reporter tintin and his dog snowy , who travel to morocco to pursue a gang of international opium smugglers . \\n  the crab with the golden claws was published in book form shortly after its conclusion . hergé continued the adventures of tintin with the shooting star , while the series itself became a defining part of the franco @-@ belgian comics tradition . in 1943 , hergé coloured and redrew the book in his distinctive ligne @-@ claire style for casterman \\'s republication . the crab with the golden claws introduces the recurring character captain haddock , who became a major fixture of the series . the book is the first tintin adventure published in the united states and the first to be adapted into a motion picture . the crab with the golden claws was adapted for the 1956 belvision studios animation hergé \\'s adventures of tintin , for the 1991 ellipse / nelvana animated series the adventures of tintin , and for the 2011 film directed by steven spielberg . \\n  = = synopsis = = \\n  tintin is informed by thomson and thompson of a case involving the ramblings of a drunken man , later killed , found with a scrap of paper from what appears to be a tin of crab meat with the word \" karaboudjan \" scrawled on it . his subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads tintin to a ship called the karaboudjan , where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins . tintin escapes from his locked room after snowy chews through his bonds and tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food , leaving the man bound and gagged in the room . tintin encounters captain haddock , an alcoholic sea captain , who is manipulated by his first mate , allan , and is unaware of his crew \\'s criminal activities . tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats jumbo , the sailor left in the cabin , while allan thinks tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom . he blows open the storeroom door , then finding it empty goes back to the captain \\'s room , where he finds jumbo tied to a chair and gagged . escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo , a seaplane tries to attack them . tintin and the captain hijack the plane , tie up the pilots , and try to reach spain . haddock \\'s drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash @-@ land in the sahara , where the crew escapes . \\n  after trekking across the desert and nearly dying of dehydration , tintin and haddock are rescued and taken to a french outpost , where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the karaboudjan . they travel to a moroccan port , and along the way are attacked by tuareg tribesmen , defending themselves with french mas @-@ 36 rifles . at the port , members of his old crew kidnap the captain after he recognises their disguised karaboudjan . tintin meets thomson and thompson who got his message , and they learn that the wealthy merchant omar ben salaad sold the crab tins ; tintin tells thomson and thompson to discreetly investigate . tintin tracks down the gang and saves the captain , but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains . haddock chases a gang @-@ member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in salaad \\'s house . upon sobering up , tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now @-@ subdued owner of the wine cellar , omar ben salaad , and realizes that he is the leader of the drug cartel . allan steals a boat and tries escaping , but tintin captures him . the police arrest the gang and free the japanese man , who introduces himself as bunji kuraki , a police detective who was trying to warn tintin of the group he was up against . he had been investigating the sailor on haddock \\'s crew who drowned ; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated . turning on the radio , tintin learns that , thanks to him , the entire organisation of the crab with the golden claws is behind bars . \\n  = = history = = \\n  = = = background = = = \\n  as the belgian army clashed with the invading germans in may 1940 , hergé and his wife fled by car to france along with tens of thousands of other belgians , first staying in paris and then heading south to puy @-@ de @-@ dôme , where they remained for six weeks . on 28 may , belgian king leopold iii officially surrendered the country to the german army to prevent further killing ; a move that hergé agreed with . germany placed belgium under occupation . hergé followed the king \\'s request that all civilians who had fled the country return ; he arrived back in brussels on 30 june . there , he found that an officer of the german army \\'s propagandastaffel occupied his house , and he also faced financial trouble , as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves ( his fee due from casterman eventually arrived ) . all belgian publications were now under the control of the german occupying force . the catholic publication le vingtième siècle and its supplement le petit vingtième , where hergé had always worked serialising the adventures of tintin , no longer had permission to continue publication . land of black gold , the story that hergé had been serialising there , had to be abandoned . victor matthys , the rexist editor of le pays réel , offered hergé employment as a cartoonist , but hergé perceived le pays réel as an explicitly political publication and thus declined the position . \\n  instead , he accepted a position with le soir , belgium \\'s largest francophone daily newspaper . confiscated from its original owners , the german authorities permitted le soir to reopen under the directorship of belgian editor raymond de becker , although it remained firmly under nazi control , supporting the german war effort and espousing anti @-@ semitism . after joining le soir on 15 october , hergé created its new children \\'s supplement , le soir jeunesse . appointed editor of this supplement , he was aided by old friend paul jamin and the cartoonist jacques van melkebeke . the first issue of le soir jeunesse was published with a large announcement across the cover : \" tintin et milou sont revenus ! \" ( \" tintin and snowy are back ! \" ) . some belgians were upset that hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying nazi administration ; he received an anonymous letter from \" the father of a large family \" asking him not to work for le soir , fearing that the adventures of tintin would now be used to indoctrinate children in nazi ideology , and that as a result \" they will no longer speak of god , of the christian family , of the catholic ideal ... [ how ] can you agree to collaborate in this terrible act , a real sin against spirit ? \" hergé however was heavily enticed by the size of le soir \\'s readership , which reached 600 @,@ 000 , far more than what le vingtième siècle had been able to accomplish . faced with the reality of nazi oversight , hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work , instead adopting a policy of neutrality . without the need to satirise political types , harry thompson observed that \" hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy . the public reacted positively . \" \\n  = = = publication = = = \\n  the crab with the golden claws began serialisation in le soir jeunesse on 17 october 1940 . however , on 8 may 1941 , a paper shortage caused by the ongoing war led to the le soir jeunesse being reduced to four pages , with the length of the weekly tintin strip being cut by two @-@ thirds . several weeks later , on 3 september 1941 , the supplement disappeared altogether , with the crab with the golden claws being moved into le soir itself in september , where it became a daily strip . as a result , hergé was forced to alter the pace at which his narrative moved , as he had to hold the reader \\'s attention at the end of every line . as with earlier adventures of tintin , the story was later serialised in france in the catholic newspaper cœurs vaillants from 21 june 1942 . \\n  following serialisation , casterman collected together and published the story in book form in 1941 ; the last black @-@ and @-@ white tintin volume to be released . for this collected edition , hergé thought of renaming the story , initially considering the red crab ( to accompany earlier adventures the blue lotus and the black island ) before re @-@ settling on le crabe aux pinces d \\'or ( the crab with the golden claws ) . hergé became annoyed that casterman then sent the book to the printers without his final approval . nevertheless , as a result of le soir \\'s publicity , book sales markedly increased , to the extent that most of the prior adventures of tintin were reprinted as a result . german authorities made two exceptions : no reprinting of tintin in america or the black island because they were set in the united states and britain respectively , both of which were in conflict with germany . \\n  the serial introduced the character of captain haddock . haddock made his first appearance in le soir adjacent to an advert for the anti @-@ semitic german film , jud süß . hergé chose the name \" haddock \" for the character after his wife , germaine remi , mentioned \" a sad english fish \" during a meal . the inclusion of the japanese police detective bunji kuraki as an ally of tintin \\'s in this story was probably designed to counterbalance hergé \\'s portrayal of the japanese as the antagonists in his earlier story , the blue lotus , particularly given that the occupying government was allied with japan at the time . the use of morocco as a setting was likely influenced by the white squadron by french writer joseph peyré , which hergé had read and seen the film in 1936 . the depiction of the french foreign legion in north africa was possibly influenced by p. c. wren \\'s novel beau geste ( 1925 ) or its cinematic adaptations in 1926 , 1928 , and 1939 . \\n  whereas hergé \\'s use of chinese in the blue lotus was correct , the arabic script employed in the crab with the golden claws was intentionally fictitious . many of the place names featured in the series are puns : the town of kefheir was a pun on the french que faire ? ( \" what is to be done ? \" ) while the port of bagghar derives from the french baggare ( scrape , or fight ) . the name of omar ben salaad is a pun meaning \" lobster salad \" in french . \\n  in february 1942 , casterman suggested to hergé that his books be published in a new format ; 62 @-@ pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages , and now in full colour rather than black @-@ and @-@ white . he agreed to this , and in 1943 the crab with the golden claws was re @-@ edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944 . due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at le soir , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long , and thus hergé filled the missing pages with four full @-@ page colour frames , thus bringing it up to the standard 62 @-@ page format . \\n  in the 1960s , the crab with the golden claws , along with king ottokar \\'s sceptre , became the first tintin adventures published in the united states , in little golden books . however , casterman , working with the american publisher western publishing , made a number of changes : jumbo , the sailor who tintin leaves bound and gagged in captain haddock \\'s cabin , as well as another man who beats haddock in the cellar , could not be black africans as depicted in the original ; these were changed to a white sailor and an arab due to the american publisher \\'s concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together . the accompanying text was not changed , however , and haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a \" negro \" . also by request of the americans , scenes of haddock drinking directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were blanked out , keeping only the text . the edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by hergé to be more acceptable , and they appear this way in published editions around the world . casterman republished the original black @-@ and @-@ white version of the story in 1980 , as part of the fourth volume in their archives hergé collection . in 1989 , they then published a facsimile version of that first edition . \\n  = = critical analysis = = \\n  hergé biographer benoît peeters described the story as a \" rebirth \" for the adventures of tintin and described the addition of haddock as \" a formidable narrative element \" , one which \" profoundly changed the spirit of the series \" . elsewhere , he asserts that it is haddock \\'s appearance which \" makes this book so memorable \" and that he is tempted to define the book by that character \\'s début . fellow biographer pierre assouline commented that the crab with the golden claws had \" a certain charm \" stemming from its use of \" exoticism and colonial nostalgia , for the french especially , evoking their holdings in north africa . \" michael farr asserted that the arrival of haddock was the most \" remarkable \" element of the story , offering the series \" tremendous new potential \" . he also thought that the dream sequences reflected the popularity of surrealism at the time , and that the influence of cinema , in particular the films of alfred hitchcock , is apparent in the story . \\n  jean @-@ marc lofficier and randy lofficier described the story as \" a thinly @-@ disguised remake of cigars of the pharaoh \" , an adventure of tintin which had been first serialised in 1934 . both feature the smuggling of opium , in crab tins and cigars respectively , and \" desert treks , hostile tribes and , at the end , the infiltrating of a secret underground lair . \" they also opined that artistically , the story represented \" a turning point in hergé \\'s career \" , because he had to switch to a daily format in le soir , although as a result of this they felt that the final third of the story \" seems rushed \" . stating that the inclusion of a japanese detective investigating drug smuggling in the mediterranean makes no sense within the context of 1940s europe , they ultimately awarded the story three out of five stars . \\n  literary critic jean @-@ marie apostolidès of stanford university , in a psychoanalytical review of the crab with the golden claws , commented that this book witnessed tintin \\'s \" real entrance into the community of human beings \" as he gains an \" older brother \" in haddock . he also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality . in particular , he believed that there was a strong homoerotic subtext between haddock and tintin , represented in the two delirious sequences ; in one , haddock envisions tintin as a champagne bottle frothing at the top ( thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis ) , while in the other , tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle , with haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him ( thereby symbolising sexual penetration ) . however , apostolidès notes , in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies . literary critic tom mccarthy concurred with apostolidès on this point , also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes . he also noted that in this adventure , the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a belgian street leads tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of \" tintin the detective \" found throughout the series . \\n  = = adaptations =

than black , usually scoring between 52 and 56 percent . white \\'s winning percentage is about the same for tournament games between humans and games between computers . however , white \\'s advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices . \\n  chess players and theoreticians have long debated whether , given perfect play by both sides , the game should end in a win for white , or a draw . since approximately 1889 , when world champion wilhelm steinitz addressed this issue , the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw . however , a few notable players have argued that white \\'s advantage may be sufficient to force a win : weaver adams and vsevolod rauzer claimed that white is winning after the first move 1.e4 , while hans berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for white . \\n  some players , including world champions such as josé raúl capablanca , emanuel lasker , and bobby fischer , have expressed fears of a \"

draws and stalemate are scored . \\n  since 1988 , chess theorists have challenged previously well @-@ established views about white \\'s advantage . grandmaster ( gm ) andrás adorján wrote a series of books on the theme that \" black is ok ! \" , arguing that the general perception that white has an advantage is founded more in psychology than reality . gm mihai suba and others contend that sometimes white \\'s initiative disappears for no apparent reason as a game progresses . the prevalent style of play for black today is to seek dynamic , unbalanced positions with active counterplay , rather than merely trying to equalize . \\n  modern writers also argue that black has certain countervailing advantages . the consensus that white should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player , who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win . some symmetrical openings ( i.e. those where both players make the same moves ) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage , either for psychological or objective reasons . \\n  = = winning percentages = = \\n  in 1946 , w.f. streeter examined the results of 5 @,@ 598 games played in 45 international chess

concluded , \" it thus appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult to win with black , but somewhat easier to draw . \" \\n  two decades later , statistician arthur m. stevens concluded in the blue book of charts to winning chess , based on a survey of 56 @,@ 972 master games that he completed in 1967 , that white scores 59 @.@ 1 % . however , stevens assembled his games from those that had been published in chess magazines , rather than complete collections of all the games played in particular events . \\n  more recent sources indicate that white scores approximately 54 to 56 percent . in 2005 , gm jonathan rowson wrote that \" the conventional wisdom is that white begins the game with a small advantage and , holding all other factors constant , scores approximately 56 % to black \\'s 44 % \" . international master ( im ) john watson wrote in 1998 that white had scored 56 % for most of the 20th century , but that this figure had recently slipped to 55 % . the website chessgames.com holds regularly updated statistics on its games database . as of january 12 , 2015 , white had won 37 @.@ 50 % , 34 @.@ 90 % were drawn , and black had won 27 @.@ 60 % out of 739 @,@

effective than 1.d4 was the sicilian defence ( 1.e4 c5 ) , which gave white only a 52 @.@ 3 % score in 145 @,@ 996 games . \\n  statistician jeff sonas , in examining data from 266 @,@ 000 games played between 1994 and 2001 , concluded that white scored 54 @.@ 1767 % plus 0 @.@ 001164 times white \\'s elo rating advantage , treating white \\'s rating advantage as + 390 if it is better than + 390 , or − 460 if it is worse than − 460 . he found that white \\'s advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points , i.e. if white has a rating 35 points below black \\'s , each player will have an expected score of 50 % . sonas also found that white \\'s advantage is smaller ( 53 % ) in rapid games than in games at a slower ( \" classical \" ) time control . in the 462 games played at the 2009 world blitz chess championship , white scored only 52 @.@ 16 % ( w38.96 d26.41 l 34 @.@ 63 ) . \\n  other writers conclude that there is a positive correlation between the players \\' ratings and white \\'s score . according to gm evgeny sveshnikov , statistics show that white has no advantage over black in games between beginners , but \" if the players are stronger , white has the lead \" . an analysis of the results of games in chessbase \\'s mega 2003 database between players with similar elo ratings , commissioned by gm andrás adorján , showed that as the players \\' ratings went up , the percentage of draws increased , the proportion of decisive games that white won increased , and white \\'s overall winning percentage increased . for example , taking the highest and lowest of adorján \\'s rating categories of 1669 games played by the highest @-@ rated players ( elo ratings 2700 and above ) , white scored 55 @.@ 7 % overall ( w26.5 d58.4 l15.2 ) , whereas of 34 @,@ 924 games played by the lowest @-@ rated players ( elo ratings below 2100 ) , white scored 53 @.@ 1 % overall ( w37.0 d32.1 l30.8 ) . adorján also analyzed the results of games played at the very highest level : world championship matches . of 755 games played in 34 matches between 1886 and 1990 , white won 234 ( 31 @.@ 0 % ) , drew 397 ( 52 @.@ 6 % ) , and lost 124 ( 16 @.@ 4 % ) , for a total white winning percentage of 57 @.@ 3 % . in the last five matches in adorjan \\'s survey , all between anatoly karpov and garry kasparov , white won 31 ( 25 @.@ 8 % ) , drew 80 ( 66 @.@ 7 % ) , and lost 9 (

forty moves in one hundred and twenty minutes per player ( 40 / 120 ) , and also 40 / 20 and 40 / 4 , and uses the results of those games to compile a rating list for each time control . at the slowest time control ( 40 / 120 ) , white has scored 55 @.@ 4 % ( w34.7 d41.3 l24.0 ) in games played among 38 of the strongest chess engines ( as of may 27 , 2009 ) . at 40 / 20 , white has scored 54

the attack . \" this is consistent with the traditional view that white , by virtue of the first move , begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame , while black should strive to neutralize white \\'s initiative and attain equality . because white begins with the initiative , a minor mistake by white generally leads only to loss of the initiative , while a similar mistake by black may have more serious consequences . thus , sveshnikov wrote in 1994 , \" black players cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view , the tasks of white and black in chess are different : white has to strive for a win , black — for a draw ! \" \\n  chess theorists have long debated how enduring white \\'s initiative is and whether , if both sides play perfectly , the game should end in a win for white or a draw . george walker wrote in 1846 that , \" the first move is an advantage , ... but if properly answered , the first move is of little worth \" . steinitz , the first world champion , who is widely considered the father of modern chess , wrote in 1889 , \" it is now conceded by all experts that by proper play on both sides the legitimate issue of a game ought to be a draw . \" lasker and capablanca , the second and third world champions , agreed . reuben fine , one of the world \\'s leading players from 1936 to 1951 , wrote that white \\'s opening advantage is too intangible to be sufficient for a win without an error by black . \\n  the view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails . even if it cannot be proved , this assumption is considered \" safe \" by rowson and \" logical \" by adorján . watson agrees that \" the proper result of a perfectly played chess game ... is a draw . ... of course , i can \\'t prove this , but i doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree . ... i remember kasparov , after a last @-@ round draw , explaining to the waiting reporters : \\' well , chess is a draw . \\' \" world champion bobby fischer thought that was almost definitely so . \\n  lasker and capablanca both worried that chess would suffer a \" draw death \" as top @-@ level players drew more and more of their games . more recently , fischer agreed , saying that the game has become played out . all three advocated changing the rules of chess to minimize the number of drawn games . lasker suggested scoring less than half a point for a draw , and more than half a point for stalemating the opponent \\'s king . capablanca in the 1920s proposed capablanca chess , a chess variant played on a larger board and with additional pieces . fischer advocated fischer random chess , another chess variant , in which the initial position of the pieces is determined at random . \\n  today some of the sharpest opening variations have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as drawing weapons . for example , at the highest levels , black often uses the marshall attack in the ruy lopez , a line where black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances , to obtain an endgame where black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play . \\n  in 2007 , gms kiril georgiev and atanas kolev asserted that much the same was true of the so @-@ called poisoned pawn variation of the najdorf sicilian , which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.nxd4 nf6 5.nc3 a6 6.bg5 e6 7.f4 qb6 ! ? this has long been considered one of the sharpest and most problematic , or even foolhardy , opening lines . the game usually continues 8.qd2 qxb2 9.rb1 qa3 . georgiev and kolev stated that 6.bg5 is seldom seen at the highest level because the main line of this variation leads , with best play , to a draw by perpetual check . they wrote that the following game \" will probably remain the last word of theory \" : \\n  francisco vallejo pons – kasparov , moscow 2004 : 1 @.@  e4 c5 2 . nf3 d6 3 @.@  d4 cxd4 4 . nxd4 nf6 5 . nc3 a6 6 . bg5 e6 7 @.@  f4 qb6

2 – 1 / 2 ( after 34 ... qd4 + , white cannot escape the checks . ) \\n  however , georgiev and kolev \\'s pessimistic assessment of 6.bg5 has since been called into question , as white succeeded with 10.e5 ( another critical line ) in several later high @-@ level games . gm zaven andriasyan wrote in 2013 that after 10.f5 , \" a forced draw results \" , but that after 10.e5 , \" we reach a very sharp position , with mutual chances . \" \\n  = = white wins = = \\n  = = = white wins with 1.e4 = = = \\n  although it is very much a minority view , three prominent twentieth @-@ century masters claimed that white \\'s advantage should or may be decisive with best play . weaver adams , then one of the leading american masters , was the best @-@ known proponent of this view , which he introduced in his 1939 book white to play and win , and continued to expound in later books and articles until shortly before his death in 1963 . adams opined that 1.e4 was white \\'s strongest move , and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter , \" white ought to win . \" adams \\' claim was widely ridiculed , and he did not succeed in demonstrating the validity of his theory in tournament and match practice . the year after his book was published , at the finals of the 1940 u.s. open tournament , he scored only one draw in his four games as white , but won all four of his games as black . adams also lost a match to im i.a. horowitz , who took the black pieces in every game . \\n  according to sveshnikov , vsevolod rauzer , a leading soviet player and theoretician during the 1930s , likewise \" claimed in the [ 1930s ] : \\' 1.e4 — and white wins ! \\' and he managed to prove it quite often \" . \\n  = = = white wins with 1.d4 = = = \\n  more recently , im hans berliner , a former world champion of correspondence chess , claimed in his 1999 book the system that 1.d4 gives white a large , and possibly decisive , advantage . berliner asserted that with best play white wins against the grünfeld defense , the modern benoni , the benko gambit and other ( unnamed ) \" major defences \" , and achieves at least a large advantage in many lines of the queen \\'s gambit declined . however , he allowed that , \" it is possible that the rules of chess are such that only some number of plausible @-@ appearing defences to 1.d4 can be refuted . \" berliner wrote that adams \\' \" theories , though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players , made an immediate and lasting impression on me . weaver w. adams was the first person i met who actually had theories about how chess should be played . \" \\n  berliner \\'s thesis , like adams \\' , has been sharply criticized . \\n  = = modern perspectives = = \\n  as explained below , chess theorists in recent decades have continued to debate the size and nature of white \\'s advantage , if any . apart from berliner , they have rejected the idea that white has a forced win from the opening position . many also reject the traditional paradigm that black \\'s objective should be to neutralize white \\'s initiative and obtain equality . \\n  = = = white has an enduring advantage = = = \\n  in 2004 , gm larry kaufman expressed a more nuanced view than adams and berliner , arguing that the initiative stemming from the first move can always be transformed into some sort of enduring advantage , albeit not necessarily a decisive one . kaufman writes , \" i don \\'t believe that white has a forced win in chess . i do however believe that with either 1.e4 or 1.d4 , white should be able to obtain some sort of advantage that persists into the endgame . if chess were scored like boxing , with drawn games awarded by some point system to the player ( if any ) who came \\' closer \\' to winning , then i believe white would indeed have a forced win in theory . \" \\n  = = = black is ok ! = = = \\n  starting in 1988 , adorján has argued in a series of books and magazine articles that \" black is ok ! \" alone amongst modern writers , adorján claims that white starts the game with essentially no advantage . he writes , \" in my opinion , the only obvious advantage for white is that if he or she plays for a draw , and does so well , then black can hardly avoid this without taking obvious risks . \" adorján goes so far as to claim that , \" the tale of white \\'s advantage is a delusion , belief in it is based on mass psychosis . \" rowson writes that adorján \\'s \" contention is one of the most important chess ideas of the last two decades ... because it has shaken our assumption that white begins the game with some advantage , and revealed its ideological nature \" . however , rowson rejects adorján \\'s claim that white has essentially no advantage , reasoning that \" \\' white is better \\' and \\' black is ok \\' need not be mutually exclusive claims \" . \\n  in one of adorján \\'s books , gm lajos portisch opined that \" at least two @-@ thirds of all \\' tested \\' openings give white an apparent advantage . \" according to portisch , for black , \" the root of the problem is that very few people know which are the openings where black is really ok . those who find these lines have nothing to fear , as black is indeed ok , but only in those variations ! \" rowson considers this an important point , noting that \" 1.d4 players struggle to get anywhere against main @-@ line slavs and 1.e4 players find the najdorf and sveshnikov sicilians particularly tough . \" \\n  = = = dynamism = = = \\n  modern writers often think of black \\'s role in more dynamic terms than merely trying to equalize . rowson writes that \" the idea of black trying to \\' equalize \\' is questionable . i think it has limited application to a few openings , rather than being an opening prescription for black in general . \" evans wrote that after one of his games against fischer , \" fischer confided his \\' secret \\' to me : unlike other masters , he sought to win with the black pieces from the start . the revelation that black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career , he said . \" likewise , watson surmised that kasparov , when playing black , bypasses the question of whether white has an opening advantage \" by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board , and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible \" . watson observes that \" energetic opening play by black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless . sometimes we say \\' dynamically balanced \\' instead of \\' equal \\' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage . this style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess , with world champions fischer and kasparov as its most visible practitioners . \" \\n  modern writers also question the idea that white has an enduring advantage . suba , in his influential 1991 book dynamic chess strategy , rejects the notion that the initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage . he contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation , and that , \" sometimes you must lose it , just like that . if you try to cling to it , by forcing the issue , your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won \\'t be able to face a vigorous counter @-@ attack . \" rowson and watson concur . watson also observes , \" because of the presumption of white being better , the juncture of the game at which black frees his game or neutralizes white \\'s plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality , even though in dynamic openings , the exhaustion of white \\'s initiative very often means that black has seized it with advantage . \" \\n  = = = countervailing advantages = = = \\n  rowson argues that both white and black have certain advantages : \\n  = = = = white \\'s advantages = = = = \\n  according to rowson , white \\'s first advantage is that , \" the advantage of the first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that white can score an \\' ace \\' ( for instance with a powerful opening novelty ) , he has more control over the pace and direction of the game , and he has a \\' second serve \\' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing . \" second , white begins the game with some initiative , although rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage , \" and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players . \" third , some players are able to use the initiative to \" play a kind of powerful \\' serve and volley \\' chess in which black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess . \" fourth , \" if white wants to draw , it is often not so easy for black to prevent this . this advantage is particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition , because white can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether white is bluffing . \" \\n  rowson cites as an example of the last phenomenon the well @-@ regarded zaitsev variation of the ruy lopez . after 1.e4 e5 2.nf3 nc6 3.bb5 a6 4.ba4 nf6 5 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 be7 6.re1 b5 7.bb3 0 @-@ 0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 bb7 10.d4 re8 ( initiating the zaitsev variation ) , white can repeat moves once with 11.ng5 rf8 12.nf3. this puts black in an awkward situation , since he must either ( a ) insist on the zaitsev with 12 ... re8 , which allows white to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.ng5 rf8 14.nf3 , or play on with a different move , or ( b ) play a different ( and possibly inferior ) variation by playing something other than 12 ... re8 . \\n  = = = = black \\'s advantages = = = = \\n  rowson argues that black also has several advantages . first , \" white \\'s alleged advantage is also a kind of obligation to play for a win , and black can often use this to his advantage . \" second , \" white \\'s \\' extra move \\' can be a burden , and sometimes white finds himself in a mild form of zugzwang ( \\' zugzwang lite \\' ) . \" third , although white begins the game with the initiative , if \" black retains a flexible position with good reactive possibilities , this initiative can be absorbed and often passes over to black . \" fourth , \" the fact that white moves before black often gives black useful information \" . suba likewise argues that white \\'s advantage is actually less than a move , since white must tip his hand first , allowing black to react to white \\'s plans . suba writes , \" in terms of the mathematical games theory , chess is a game of complete information , and black \\'s information is always greater — by one move ! \" \\n  rowson also notes that black \\'s chances increase markedly by playing good openings , which tend to be those with flexibility and latent potential , \" rather than those that give white fixed targets or that try to take the initiative prematurely . \" he also emphasizes that \" white has \\' the initiative \\' , not \\' the advantage \\' . success with black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of \\' potential \\' . \" these ideas are exemplified by the hedgehog , a dynamic modern system against the english opening that can arise from various move orders . a typical position arises after 1.c4 c5 2.nf3 nf6 3.g3 b6 4.bg2 bb7 5 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 e6 6.nc3 be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.qxd4 d6 9.e4 a6 . white has a spatial advantage , while black often maneuvers his pieces on the last two ranks of the board , but white \" has to keep a constant eye on the possible liberating pawn thrusts ... b5 and ... d5 . \" watson remarks , \" black \\'s goal is to remain elastic and flexible , with many options for his pieces , whereas white can become paralyzed at some point by the need to protect against various dynamic pawn breaks . \" he also observes that , \" white tends to be as much tied up by black \\'s latent activity as black himself is tied up by white \\'s space advantage . \" moreover , attempts by white to overrun black \\'s position often rebound disastrously . an example of this is the

and black \\'s respective advantages : \\n  = = = = = reversed openings = = = = = \\n  in a \" reversed opening \" , white plays an opening typically played by black , but with colors reversed and thus an extra tempo . evans writes of such openings , \" if a defense is considered good for black , it must be even better for white with a move in hand . \" former world champion mikhail botvinnik reportedly expressed the same view . watson questions this idea , citing suba \\'s thesis that black , by moving second , has more complete information than white . he writes , \" everyone has such difficulties playing as white against a sicilian defence ( 1.e4 c5 ) , but ... leading masters have no qualms about answering 1.c4 with 1 ... e5 . \" to explain this paradox , watson discusses several different reversed sicilian lines , showing how black can exploit the disadvantages of various \" extra \" moves for white . he concludes , \" the point is , black \\'s set @-@ up in the sicilian is fine as a reactive system , but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as white . this is true because black is able to react to the specific plan white chooses ; in suba \\'s terms , his information is indeed a move greater ! furthermore , he is able to take advantage of dead equal positions which white ( hoping to retain the advantage of the first move ) would normally avoid . \" \\n  watson also observes , \" similarly , the dutch defence looks particularly sterile when white achieves the reversed positions a tempo up ( it turns out that he has nothing useful to do ! ) ; and indeed , many standard black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as white , tempo in hand . \" gm alex yermolinsky likewise notes that gm vladimir malaniuk , a successful exponent of the leningrad dutch ( 1.d4 f5 2.g3 g6 ) at the highest levels , \" once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone \\'s suggestion that he should try 1.f4 as white . he smiled and said , \\' that extra move \\'s gonna hurt me . \\' \" \\n  yermolinsky also agrees with alekhine \\'s criticism of 1.g3 e5 2.nf3 , a reversed alekhine \\'s defense , in réti – alekhine , baden @-@ baden 1925 , writing that alekhine \" understood the difference in opening philosophies for white and black , and realized they just can \\'t be the same ! white is supposed to try for more than just obtaining a comfortable game in reversed colour opening set @-@ ups , and , as the statistics show — surprisingly for a lot of people , but not for me — white doesn \\'t even score as well as black does in the same positions with his extra tempo and all . \" howard staunton , generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from 1843 to 1851 , made a similar point over 160 years ago , writing that owen \\'s defense ( 1.e4 b6 ) is playable for black , but that 1.b3 is inferior to \" the more customary [ first ] moves , from its being essentially defensive \" . the current view is that owen \\'s defense is slightly better for white , while 1.b3 is playable but less likely to yield an opening advantage than 1.e4 or 1.d4. \\n  watson concludes that ( a ) \" most moves have disadvantages as well as advantages , so an extra move is not always an unqualified blessing \" ; ( b ) \" with his extra information about what white is doing , black can better react to the new situation \" ; and ( c ) because a draw is likely to be more acceptable to black than to white , white is apt to avoid lines that allow drawish simplifications , while black may not object to such lines . \\n  = = = = = symmetrical openings = = = = = \\n  rowson writes that \" in general one would assume that whatever advantage white has would be revealed most clearly in symmetrical positions . \" accordingly , watson , suba , evans , and the eminent player and theorist aron nimzowitsch ( 1886 – 1935 ) have all argued that it is in black \\'s interest to avoid symmetry . nonetheless , even symmetrical opening lines sometimes illustrate the tenuous nature of white \\'s advantage , in several respects . \\n  it is often difficult for white to prove an advantage in

theoretical . \" gm andrew soltis wrote in 2008 that he hates playing against the symmetrical petroff \\'s defense ( 1.e4 e5 2.nf3 nf6 ) , and accordingly varies with 2.nc3 , the vienna game . however , there too he has been unable to find a way to an advantage after the symmetrical 2 ... nc6 3.g3 g6 4.bg2 bg7 , or after 3.nf3 nf6 ( transposing to the four knights game ) 4.bb5 bb4 5 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 0

disadvantageous to white in that he has to commit himself first . watson notes that it is even difficult for white to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position , since almost every move has certain drawbacks . fischer once went so far as to claim that after 1.nf3 nf6 2.g3 g6 3.bg2 bg7 4 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 0 @-@ 0 5.d3 d6 ( reinhard – fischer , western open 1963 ) , \" \\' believe it or not ,

responded in chess magazine , \" we just don \\'t believe it ! \" in symmetrical positions , as the hodgson – arkell and portisch – tal games discussed below illustrate , black can continue to imitate white as long as he finds it feasible and desirable to do so , and deviate when that ceases to be the case . \\n  further , a particular extra move is sometimes more of a liability than an asset . for example , soltis notes that the exchange french position arising after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 exd5 4.nf3 nf6 \" is pretty equal . \" the same position , but with black \\'s knight moved to e4 , arises in petroff \\'s defense after 1.e4 e5 2.nf3 nf6 3.nxe5 d6 4.nf3 nxe4 5.d4 d5 . that position offers white better chances precisely because black \\'s extra move ( ... ne4 ) allows the advanced knight to become a target for attack . \\n  finally , symmetrical positions may be difficult for the white player for psychological reasons . watson writes that anyone who tries the exchange french , \" even if he thinks he is playing for a win , assume [ s ] a psychological burden . white has already ceded the advantage of the first move , and knows it , whereas black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative . \" two famous examples of white losses in the exchange french are m. gurevich – short and tatai – korchnoi . in m. gurevich – short , a game between two of the world \\'s leading players , white needed only a draw to qualify for the candidates matches , while black needed to win . gurevich played passively and was outplayed by short , who achieved the necessary win , qualified for the candidates , and ultimately went on to challenge kasparov for the world championship . in tatai – korchnoi , the italian im fell victim to korchnoi \\'s whirlwind mating attack , losing in just 14 moves . \\n  rowson gives the following example of black outplaying white from the symmetrical variation of the english opening . he remarks , \" there is something compelling about black \\'s strategy . he seems to be saying : \\' i will copy all your good moves , and as soon as you make a bad move , i won \\'t copy you any more ! \\' \" \\n  hodgson – arkell , newcastle 2001 : 1 @.@  c4

famous game as white from a symmetrical position in tal – beliavsky , ussr championship 1974 . \\n  = = tournament and match play = = \\n  in chess tournaments and matches , the frequency with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration . in matches , the players \\' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots , and alternated thereafter . in round robin tournaments with an odd number of players , each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks ; with an even number of players , each receives one extra white or black . where one or more players withdraws from the tournament , the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites , or vice versa . the double @-@ round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings , since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks , and plays both white and black against each opponent . \\n  in swiss system tournaments , the tournament director tries to ensure that each player receives , as nearly as possible , the same number of games as white and black , and that the player \\'s color alternates from round to round . after the first round , the director may deviate from the otherwise prescribed pairings in order to give as many players as possible their equalizing or due colors . more substantial deviations are permissible to avoid giving a player two more blacks than whites ( for example , three blacks in four games ) than vice versa , since extra whites \" cause far less player distress \" than extra blacks , which impose \" a significant handicap \" on the affected player . tournaments with an even number of rounds cause the most problems , since if there is a disparity , it is greater ( e.g. , a player receiving two whites and four blacks ) . \\n  = = solving chess = = \\n  endgame tablebases have solved a very limited area of chess , determining perfect play in a number of endgames , including all non @-@ trivial endgames with no more than six pieces or pawns ( including the two kings ) . seven @-@ piece endgames were solved in 2012 and released as \" lomonosov tablebases \" . \\n  jonathan rowson has speculated that \" in principle it should be possible for a machine to ... develop 32 @-@ piece tablebases . this may take decades or even centuries , but unless runaway global warming or nuclear war gets in the way , i think it will eventually happen . \" however , information theorist claude shannon argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this . in his 1950 paper \" programming a computer for playing chess \" he writes : \\n  with chess it is possible , in principle , to play a perfect game or construct a machine to do so as follows : one considers in a given position all possible moves , then all moves for the opponent , etc . , to the end of the game ( in each variation ) . the end must occur , by the rules of the games after a finite number of moves ( remembering the 50 move drawing rule ) . each of these variations ends in win , loss or draw . by working backward from the end one can determine whether there is a forced win , the position is a draw or is lost . it is easy to show , however , even with the high computing speed available in electronic calculators this computation is impractical . in typical chess positions there will be of the order of 30 legal moves . the number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly finished as shown ... by de groot , who averaged the number of legal moves in a large number of master games . thus a move for white and then one for black gives about 103 possibilities . a typical game lasts about 40 moves to resignation of one party . this is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to checkmate , not resignation . however , even at this figure there will be 10120 variations to be calculated from the initial position . a machine operating at the rate of one variation per microsecond would require over 1090 years to calculate the first move ! \\n  it is thus theoretically possible to \" solve \" chess , determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for white , a draw , or even a win for black . however , according to shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology . \\n  hans @-@ joachim bremermann , a professor of mathematics and biophysics at the university of california at berkeley , further argued in a 1965 paper that the \" speed , memory , and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers : the light barrier , the quantum barrier , and the thermodynamical barrier . these limitations imply , for example , that no computer , however constructed , will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess . \" nonetheless , bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess . he wrote , \" in order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [ of chess ] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching . ... a theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming , however , is still very much wanting . \" \\n  recent scientific advances have not significantly changed that assessment . the game of checkers was solved in 2007 , but it has roughly the square root of the number of positions in chess . jonathan schaeffer , the scientist who led the effort , said a breakthrough such as quantum computing would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted , but he does not rule out the possibility , saying that the one thing he learned from his 16 @-@ year effort of solving checkers \" is to never underestimate the advances in technology \" . \\n  = = quotation = = \\n  \" you will win with either color if you are the better player , but it takes longer with black . \" – isaac kashdan \\n  =

of the neutrino with clyde cowan in the neutrino experiment . he may be the only scientist in history \" so intimately associated with the discovery of an elementary particle and the subsequent thorough investigation of its fundamental properties \" . \\n  a graduate of the stevens institute of technology and new york university , reines joined the manhattan project \\'s los alamos laboratory in 1944 , working in the theoretical division in richard feynman \\'s group . he became a group leader there in 1946 . he participated in a number of nuclear tests , culminating in his becoming the director of the operation greenhouse test series in the pacific in 1951 . \\n  in the early 1950s , working in hanford and savannah river sites , reines and cowan developed the equipment and procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in june 1956 . reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino \\'s properties and interactions , which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to come . this included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays , and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from supernova sn1987a , which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy . \\n  = = early life = = \\n  frederick reines was born in paterson , new jersey , one of four children of gussie ( cohen ) and israel reines . his parents were jewish emigrants from the same town in russia , but only met in new york city , where they were later married . he had an older sister , paula , who became a doctor , and two older brothers , david and william , who became lawyers . he said that his \" early education was strongly influenced \" by his studious siblings . he was the great @-@ nephew of the rabbi yitzchak yaacov reines , the founder of mizrachi , a religious zionist movement . \\n  the family moved to hillburn , new york , where his father ran the general store , and he spent much of his childhood . he was an eagle scout . looking back , reines said : \" my early childhood memories center around this typical american country store and life in a small american town , including independence day july celebrations marked by fireworks and patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand . \" \\n  reines sang in a chorus , and as a soloist . for a time he considered the possibility of a singing career , and was instructed by a vocal coach from the metropolitan opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them . the family later moved to north bergen , new jersey , residing on kennedy boulevard and 57th street . because north bergen did not have a high school , he attended union hill high school in union hill , new jersey , from which he graduated in 1935 . \\n  from an early age , reines exhibited an interest in science , and liked creating and building things . he later recalled that : \\n  the first stirrings of interest in science that i remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school , when , looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope , i noticed something peculiar about the light ; it was the phenomenon of diffraction . that began for me a fascination with light . \\n  ironically , reines excelled in literary and history courses , but received average or low marks in science and math in his freshman year of high school , though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him a key to the school laboratory . this cultivated a love of science by his senior year . in response to a question seniors were asked about what they wanted to do for a yearbook quote , he responded : \" to be a physicist extraordinaire . \" \\n  reines was accepted into the massachusetts institute of technology , but chose instead to attend stevens institute of technology in hoboken , new jersey , where he earned his bachelor of science ( b.s. ) degree in mechanical engineering in 1939 , and his master of science ( m.s. ) degree in mathematical physics in 1941 , writing a thesis on \" a critical review of optical diffraction theory \" . he married sylvia samuels on august 30 , 1940 . they had two children , robert and alisa . he then entered new york university , where he earned his doctor of philosophy ( ph.d. ) in 1944 . he studied cosmic rays there under serge a. korff , but wrote his thesis under the supervision of richard d. present on \" nuclear fission and the liquid drop model of the nucleus \" . publication of the thesis was delayed until after the end of world war ii ; it appeared in physical review in 1946 . \\n  = = los alamos laboratory = = \\n  in 1944 richard feynman recruited reines to work in the theoretical division at the manhattan project \\'s los alamos laboratory , where he would remain for the next fifteen years . he joined feynman \\'s t @-@ 4 ( diffusion problems ) group , which was part of hans bethe \\'s t ( theoretical ) division . diffusion was an important aspect of critical mass calculations . in june 1946 , he became a group leader , heading the t @-@ 1 ( theory of dragon ) group . an outgrowth of the \" tickling the dragon \\'s tail \" experiment , the dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time , which could be used as a research tool or power source . \\n  reines participated in a number of nuclear tests , and writing reports on their results . these included operation crossroads at bikini atoll in 1946 , operation sandstone at eniwetok atoll in 1948 , and operation ranger and operation buster – jangle at the nevada test site . in 1951 he was the director of operation greenhouse series of nuclear tests in the pacific . this saw the first american tests of boosted fission weapons , an important step towards thermonuclear weapons . he studied the effects of nuclear blasts , and co @-@ authored a paper with john von neumann on mach stem formation , an important aspect of an air blast wave . \\n  in spite or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests , reines was concerned about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests , and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing . in the wake of the sputnik crisis , he participated in john archibald wheeler \\'s project 137 , which evolved into jason . he was also a delegate at the atoms for peace conference in geneva in 1958 . \\n  = = discovery of the neutrino and the inner workings of stars = = \\n  the neutrino was a subatomic particle first proposed theoretically by wolfgang pauli on december 4 , 1930 , to explain undetected energy that escaped during beta decay when neutron decayed into a proton and an electron so that the law of conservation of energy was not violated . enrico fermi renamed it the neutrino , italian for \" little neutral one \" , and in 1934 , proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton , an electron , and a neutrino : \\n  n0 → p + + e − + ν \\n  e \\n  the neutrino accounted for the missing energy , but fermi \\'s theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that would be difficult to observe directly . in a 1934 paper , rudolf peierls and hans bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the earth , and concluded \" there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino . \" in 1951 , at the conclusion of the greenhouse test series , reines received permission from the head of t division , j. carson mark , for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics . reines and his colleague clyde cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos . \" so why did we want to detect the free neutrino ? \" he later explained , \" because everybody said , you couldn ’ t do it . \" \\n  according to fermi \\'s theory , there was also a corresponding reverse reaction , in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron : \\n  ν \\n  e + p + → n0 + e + \\n  the positron would soon be annihilated by an electron and produce two 0 @.@ 51 mev gamma rays , while the neutron would be captured by a proton and release a 2 @.@ 2 mev gamma ray . this would produce a distinctive signature that could be detected . they then realised that by adding cadmium salt to their liquid scintillator to enhance the neutron capture reaction , resulting in a 9 mev burst of gamma rays . for a neutrino source , they proposed using an atomic bomb . permission for this was obtained from the laboratory director , norris bradbury . work began on digging a shaft for the experiment when j. m. b. kellogg convinced them to use a nuclear reactor instead of a bomb . although a less intense source of neutrinos , it had the advantage in allowing for multiple experiments to be carried out over a long period of time . \\n  in 1953 , they made their first attempts using one of the large reactors at the hanford nuclear site in what is now known as the cowan – reines neutrino experiment . their detector now included 300 litres ( 66 imp gal ; 79 us gal ) of scintillating fluid and 90 photomultiplier tubes , but the effort was frustrated by background noise from cosmic rays . with encouragement from john a. wheeler , they tried again in 1955 , this time using one of the newer , larger 700 mw reactors at the savannah river site that emitted a high neutrino flux of 1 @.@ 2 x 1012 / cm2 sec . they also had a convenient , well @-@ shielded location 11 metres ( 36 ft ) from the reactor and 12 metres ( 39 ft ) underground . on june 14 , 1956 , they were able to send pauli a telegram announcing that the neutrino had been found . when bethe was informed that he had been proven wrong , he said , \" well , you shouldn ’ t believe everything you read in the papers . \" \\n  from then on reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino ’ s properties and interactions , which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come . cowan left los alamos in 1957 to teach at george washington university , ending their collaboration . on the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino , reines became the head of the physics department of case western reserve university from 1959 to 1966 . at case , he led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays . reines had a booming voice , and had been a singer since childhood . during this time , besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department , reines sang in the cleveland orchestra chorus under the direction of robert shaw in performances with george szell and the cleveland orchestra . \\n  in 1966 , reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new university of california , irvine ( uci ) , becoming its first dean of physical sciences . at uci , reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors , such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy . \\n  reines had prepared for the possibility of measuring the distant events of a supernova explosion . supernova explosions are rare , but reines thought he might be lucky enough to see one in his lifetime , and be able to catch the neutrinos streaming from it in his specially @-@ designed detectors . during his wait for a supernova to explode , he put signs on some of his large neutrino detectors , calling them \" supernova early warning systems \" . in 1987 , neutrinos emitted from supernova sn1987a were detected by the irvine – michigan – brookhaven ( imb ) collaboration , which used an 8 @,@ 000 ton cherenkov detector located in a salt mine near cleveland . normally , the detectors recorded only a few background events each day . the supernova registered 19 events in just ten seconds . this discovery is regarded as inaugurating the field of neutrino astronomy . \\n  in 1995 , reines was honored , along with martin l. perl with the nobel prize in physics for his work with cowan in first detecting the neutrino . unfortunately , cowan had died in 1974 , and the nobel prize is not awarded posthumously . reines also received many other awards , including the j. robert oppenheimer memorial prize in 1981 , the national medal of science in 1985 , the bruno rossi prize in 1989 , the michelson – morley award in 1990 , the panofsky prize in 1992 , and the franklin medal in 1992 . he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences in 1980 and a foreign member of the russian academy of sciences in 1994 . he remained dean of physical sciences at uci until 1974 , and became a professor emeritus in 1988 , but he

the munsee had abandoned their island villages and other villages in the area . \\n  with the signing of the first treaty of fort stanwix in 1768 , the british gained control from the iroquois of lands south of the west branch . however , white settlers continued to appropriate land , including tracts in and near the future site of lock haven , not covered by the treaty . in 1769 , cleary campbell , the first white settler in the area , built a log cabin near the present site of lock haven university of pennsylvania , and by 1773 william reed , another settler , had built a cabin surrounded by a stockade and called it reed \\'s fort . it was the westernmost of 11 mostly primitive forts along the west branch ; fort augusta , at what is now sunbury , was the easternmost and most defensible . in response to settler incursions , and encouraged by the british during the american revolution ( 1775 – 83 ) , indians attacked colonists and their settlements along the west branch . fort reed and the other white settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned in 1778 during a general evacuation known as the big runaway . hundreds of people fled along the river to fort augusta , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from fort reed ; some did not return for five years . in 1784 , the second treaty of fort stanwix , between the iroquois and the united states , transferred most of the remaining indian territory in pennsylvania , including what would become lock haven , to the state . the u.s. acquired the last remaining tract , the erie triangle , through a separate treaty and sold it to pennsylvania in 1792 . \\n  = = = nineteenth century = = = \\n  lock haven was laid out as a town in 1833 , and it became the county seat in 1839 , when the county was created out of parts of lycoming and centre counties . incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870 , lock haven prospered in the 19th century largely because of timber and transportation . the forests of clinton county and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak , ash , maple , poplar , cherry , beech , and magnolia . the wood was used locally for such things as frame houses , shingles , canal boats , and wooden bridges , and whole logs were floated to chesapeake bay and on to baltimore , to make spars for ships . log driving and log rafting , competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills , began along the west branch around 1800 . by 1830 , slightly before the founding of the town , the lumber industry was well established . \\n  the west branch canal , which opened in 1834 , ran 73 miles ( 117 km ) from northumberland to farrandsville , about 5 miles ( 8 km ) upstream from lock haven . a state @-@ funded extension called the bald eagle cut ran from the west branch through lock haven and flemington to bald eagle creek . a privately funded extension , the bald eagle and spring creek navigation , eventually reached bellefonte , 24 miles ( 39 km ) upstream . lock haven \\'s founder , jeremiah church , and his brother , willard , chose the town site in 1833 partly because of the river , the creek , and the canal . church named the town lock haven because it had a canal lock and because it was a haven for loggers , boatmen , and other travelers . over the next quarter century , canal boats 12 feet ( 4 m ) wide and 80 feet ( 24 m ) long carried passengers and mail as well as cargo such as coal , ashes for lye and soap , firewood , food , furniture , dry goods , and clothing . a rapid increase in lock haven \\'s population ( to 830 by 1850 ) followed the opening of the canal . \\n  a lock haven log boom , smaller than but otherwise similar to the susquehanna boom at williamsport , was constructed in 1849 . large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the dunnstown dam , named for a settlement on the shore opposite lock haven . the piers , about 150 feet ( 46 m ) from one another , stretched in a line from the dam to a point 3 miles ( 5 km ) upriver . connected by timbers shackled together with iron yokes and rings , the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced floating logs . workers called boom rats sorted the captured logs , branded like cattle , for delivery to sawmills and other owners . lock haven became the lumber center of clinton county and the site of many businesses related to forest products . \\n  the sunbury and erie railroad , renamed the philadelphia and erie railroad in 1861 , reached lock haven in 1859 , and with it came a building boom . hoping that the area \\'s coal , iron ore , white pine , and high @-@ quality clay would produce significant future wealth , railroad investors led by christopher and john fallon financed a line to lock haven . on the strength of the railroad \\'s potential value to the city , local residents had invested heavily in housing , building large homes between 1854 and 1856 . although the fallons \\' coal and iron ventures failed , gothic revival , greek revival , and italianate mansions and commercial buildings such as the fallon house , a large hotel , remained , and the railroad provided a new mode of transport for the ongoing timber era . a second rail line , the bald eagle valley railroad , originally organized as the tyrone and lock haven railroad and completed in the 1860s , linked lock haven to tyrone , 56 miles ( 90 km ) to the southwest . the two rail lines soon became part of the network controlled by the pennsylvania railroad . \\n  during the era of log floating , logjams sometimes occurred when logs struck an obstacle . log rafts floating down the west branch had to pass through chutes in canal dams . the rafts were commonly 28 feet ( 9 m ) wide — narrow enough to pass through the chutes — and 150 feet ( 46 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) long . in 1874 , a large raft got wedged in the chute of the dunnstown dam and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank with a pile of logs 16 feet ( 5 m ) high . the jam eventually trapped another 200 log rafts , and 2 canal boats , the mammoth of newport and the sarah dunbar . \\n  in terms of board feet , the peak of the lumber era in pennsylvania arrived in about 1885 , when 1 @.@ 9 million logs went through the boom at williamsport . these logs produced a total of about 226 million board feet ( 533 @,@ 000 m3 ) of sawed lumber . after that , production steadily declined throughout the state . lock haven \\'s timber business was also affected by flooding , which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889 . \\n  the central state normal school , established to train teachers for central pennsylvania , held its first classes in 1877 at a site overlooking the west branch susquehanna river . the small school , with enrollments below 150 until the 1940s , eventually became lock haven university of pennsylvania . in the early 1880s , the new york and pennsylvania paper mill in castanea township near flemington began paper production on the site of a former sawmill ; the paper mill remained a large employer until the end of the 20th century . \\n  = = = twentieth century = = = \\n  as older forms of transportation such as the canal boat disappeared , new forms arose . one of these , the electric trolley , began operation in lock haven in 1894 . the lock haven electric railway , managed by the lock haven traction company and after 1900 by the susquehanna traction company , ran passenger trolleys between lock haven and mill hall , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the west . the trolley line extended from the philadelphia and erie railroad station in lock haven to a station of the central railroad of pennsylvania , which served mill hall . the route went through lock haven \\'s downtown , close to the normal school , across town to the trolley car barn on the southwest edge of the city , through flemington , over the bald eagle canal and bald eagle creek , and on to mill hall via what was then known as the lock haven , bellefonte , and nittany valley turnpike . plans to extend the line from mill hall to salona , 3 miles ( 5 km ) miles south of mill hall , and to avis 10 miles ( 16 km ) northeast of lock haven , were never carried out , and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines . the system , always financially marginal , declined after world war i. losing business to automobiles and buses , it ceased operations around 1930 . \\n  william t. piper , sr. , built the piper aircraft corporation factory in lock haven in 1937 after the company \\'s taylor aircraft manufacturing plant in bradford , pennsylvania , was destroyed by fire . the factory began operations in a building that once housed a silk mill . as the company grew , the original factory expanded to include engineering and office buildings . piper remained in the city until 1984 , when its new owner , lear @-@ siegler , moved production to vero beach , florida . the clinton county historical society opened the piper aviation museum at the site of the former factory in 1985 , and 10 years later the museum became an independent organization . \\n  the state of pennsylvania acquired central state normal school in 1915 and renamed it lock haven state teachers college in 1927 . between 1942 and 1970 , the student population grew from 146 to more than 2 @,@ 300 ; the number of teaching faculty rose from 25 to 170 , and the college carried out a large building program . the school \\'s name was changed to lock haven state college in 1960 , and its emphasis shifted to include the humanities , fine arts , mathematics , and social sciences , as well as teacher education . becoming lock haven university of pennsylvania in 1983 , it opened a branch campus in clearfield , 48 miles ( 77 km ) west of lock haven , in 1989 . \\n  an 8 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 2 ha ) industrial area in castanea township adjacent to lock haven was placed on the national priorities list of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites ( commonly referred to as superfund sites ) in 1982 . drake chemical , which went bankrupt in 1981 , made ingredients for pesticides and other compounds at the site from the 1960s to 1981 . starting in 1982 , the united states environmental protection agency began a clean @-@ up of contaminated containers , buildings , and soils at the site and by the late 1990s had replaced the soils . equipment to treat contaminated groundwater at the site was installed in 2000 and continues to operate . \\n  = = = floods = = = \\n  pennsylvania \\'s streams have frequently flooded . according to william h. shank , the native americans of pennsylvania warned white settlers that great floods occurred on the delaware and susquehanna rivers every 14 years . shank tested this idea by tabulating the highest floods on record at key points throughout the state over a 200 @-@ year period and found that a major flood had occurred , on average , once every 25 years between 1784 and 1972 . big floods recorded at harrisburg , on the main stem of the susquehanna about 120 miles ( 193 km ) miles downstream from lock haven , occurred in 1784 , 1865 , 1889 , 1894 , 1902 , 1936 , and 1972 . readings from the williamsport stream gauge , 24 miles ( 39 km ) miles below lock haven on the west branch of the susquehanna , showed major flooding between 1889 and 1972 in the same years as the harrisburg station ; in addition , a large flood occurred on the west branch at williamsport in 1946 . estimated flood @-@ crest readings between 1847 and 1979 — based on data from the national weather service flood gauge at lock haven — show that flooding likely occurred in the city 19 times in 132 years . the biggest flood occurred on march 18 , 1936 , when the river crested at 32 @.@ 3 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) , which was about 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) above the flood stage of 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) . \\n  the third biggest flood , cresting at 29 @.@ 8 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) in lock haven , occurred on june 1 , 1889 , and coincided with the johnstown flood . the flood demolished lock haven \\'s log boom , and millions of feet of stored timber were swept away . the flood damaged the canals , which were subsequently abandoned , and destroyed the last of the canal boats based in the city . \\n  the most damaging lock haven flood was caused by the remnants of hurricane agnes in 1972 . the storm , just below hurricane strength when it reached the region , made landfall on june 22 near new york city . agnes merged with a non @-@ tropical low on june 23 , and the combined system affected the northeastern united states until june 25 . the combination produced widespread rains of 6 to 12 inches ( 152 to 305 mm ) with local amounts up to 19 inches ( 483 mm ) in western schuylkill county , about 75 miles ( 121 km ) southeast of lock haven . at lock haven , the river crested on june 23 at 31 @.@ 3 feet ( 9 @.@ 5 m ) , second only to the 1936 crest . the flood greatly damaged the paper mill and piper aircraft . \\n  federal , state , and local governments began construction in 1992 of barriers to protect the city . the project included a levee of 36 @,@ 000 feet ( 10 @,@ 973 m ) and a flood wall of 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 m ) along the susquehanna river and bald eagle creek , closure structures , retention basins , a pumping station , and some relocation of roads and buildings . completed in 1995 , the levee protected the city from high water in the year of the blizzard of 1996 , and again 2004 , when rainfall from the remnants of hurricane ivan threatened the city . \\n  = = geography = = \\n  lock haven is the county seat of clinton county . according to the united states census bureau , the city

remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history , in spite of aniston \\'s own resentment towards it . rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s . meanwhile , the character \\'s relationship with ross is often cited among television \\'s most beloved . \\n  rachel is considered to be aniston \\'s breakout role , credited with making her the show \\'s most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career . praised for her performance as rachel , aniston won both an emmy award for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series and a golden globe award for best performance by an actress in a television series – comedy or musical . \\n  = = role = = \\n  rachel debuts in the pilot episode of friends as a runaway bride who is

leblanc ) , and chandler bing ( matthew perry ) , while reuniting with monica \\'s older brother ross geller ( david schwimmer ) , who has harbored unrequited romantic feelings for her since high

central perk , a coffeehouse where her new friends regularly socialize . \\n  as season one concludes , rachel finally confesses her love for ross , having learned of his feelings for her from chandler , only to find that he has already begun dating another woman , whom she resents . however , ross eventually chooses rachel over his girlfriend julie ( lauren tom ) , and the couple dates for

. rachel ultimately decides to stay and reignite her relationship with ross , getting off the plane at the last minute . \\n  = = development = = \\n  = = = conception and writing = = = \\n  after their short @-@ lived television series family album was canceled , television writers david crane and marta kauffman pitched friends to then @-@ nbc president warren littlefield as a sitcom about \" that special time in your life when your friends are your family , \" basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in new york ; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends . conceived as a young woman who is unprepared for adulthood , the character rachel green was originally named rachel robbins . although critics and audiences initially perceived monica as the show \\'s main character when friends premiered , the writers had actually given rachel the pilot \\'s most prominent storyline . before deciding that rachel and ross would be an item for the entire series , the writers had originally intended for the show \\'s defining couple to be joey and monica . however , after the success of the pilot , in which rachel and ross \\' developing romance is first hinted at , and witnessing aniston and co @-@ star david schwimmer \\'s on @-@ screen chemistry for the first time , crane and kauffman determined that the entire series relied on \" finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other . \" \\n  audiences began rooting for rachel and ross \\' union since the very beginning of friends , openly voicing their frustration with rachel ’ s obliviousness to ross \\' feelings for her . the episode that would ultimately transform the friends \\' relationship for the remainder of the series was the first season finale \" the one where rachel finds out \" , in which rachel finally learns of ross \\' true feelings for her , at the same time discovering she actually feels the same . however , the episode nearly went unwritten because , at the time , few friends writers were expecting the couple \\'s relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became . the episode was first suggested by director james burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple \\'s dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive \" he \\'s pining , she \\'s oblivious \" pattern , using the work of author jane austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from ross to rachel . because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , \" the one where rachel finds out \" became friends \\' most reworked episode . the couple \\'s first kiss at the end of season two \\'s \" the one where ross finds out \" was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . jonathan bernstein of the daily telegraph believes that they accomplished this by \" dangl [ ing ] the possibility of a ross and rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together . \" according to encyclopedia of television author horace newcomb , ross and rachel \\'s ever @-@ changing relationship \" converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama . \" meanwhile , writing for the new york review of books , elaine blair agreed that friends created \" a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way , setting us up for a long @-@ deferred union . \" \\n  after rachel and ross drunkenly get married while on vacation in las vegas during season five , schwimmer had initially objected to the idea of having his character ross divorce her – his third divorce – because he felt that it was taking it \" too far . \" the actor explained that \" the whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [ ross ] to be able to move on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with rachel later just went a bit too far . \" rachel and joey \\'s romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay ross and rachel \\'s reunion further . crane felt that pairing rachel and joey during season ten \" was for the greater good \" because \" it was inappropriate . \" however , the cast initially protested the idea , fearing that rachel , joey , and ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either \" resent joey for going after a pregnant woman , or resent rachel for rejecting him , or resent ross for standing between the two of them . \" meanwhile , the writers also approached the concept of rachel \\'s pregnancy and baby tentatively , worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want friends \" to become a show about a baby \" while \" on the other hand , we don \\'t want to pretend that there isn \\'t one . \" according to robert bianco of usa today , the critical success and popularity of rachel \\'s pregnancy is ultimately responsible for \" propel [ ling ] the show to the top of the ratings \" . when it finally came time to write the series finale , \" the only thing [ crane and kauffman ] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get ross and rachel together , \" deciding , \" we had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their \\' will they or won ’ t they , \\' and we didn ’ t see any advantage in frustrating them \" any longer . however , at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with ross and rachel in \" a gray area of where they aren ’ t together , but we hint there ’ s a sense that they might be down the road . \" ultimately , crane and kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want . \\n  = = = casting = = = \\n  the final character to be cast , rachel is portrayed by actress jennifer aniston , who auditioned for the role shortly after declining a position as a cast member on the sketch comedy show saturday night live . her decision was initially ridiculed by both her friends as well as actor adam sandler , a saturday night live alum . actress téa leoni , who at the time was being referred to by the media as \" the next lucille ball \" , was offered the role of rachel as the studio \\'s first choice , but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom the naked truth . actress elizabeth berkley also auditioned for the role prior to being cast in the teen sitcom saved by the bell . other actresses who auditioned for rachel include denise richards , melissa rivers , nicolette sheridan , parker posey , and jami gertz . originally , the producers wanted to cast actress courteney cox as rachel , who crane and kauffman were particularly drawn to because of her \" cheery , upbeat energy . \" additionally , cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors . however , the actress lobbied for the role of rachel \\'s best friend monica , as whom she was ultimately cast , because she felt that she was not \" quirky \" enough to play rachel . at the same time , although unbeknownst to each other , aniston was being considered for the role of monica , but fought to play rachel because she felt that the character suited her better . at one point , cox had begun to regret her decision to play monica until her own character \\'s storylines started improving . \\n  friends was aniston \\'s sixth sitcom ; each of her previous ventures had been canceled prematurely . feeling vulnerable , aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for friends , which was being referred to as friends like these at the time . crane and kauffman had worked with aniston prior to this . however , casting her as rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing cbs sitcom called muddling through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . cbs was initially reluctant to release aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back @-@ and @-@ forth between muddling through and friends for two weeks . meanwhile , nbc risked having to recast the role of rachel , replace aniston , and reshoot several episodes if cbs \\' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . however , littlefield remained confident that muddling through would fail . essentially , the producers of friends hoped that muddling through would be canceled before friends premiered , while aniston feared that muddling through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards friends . during this time of uncertainty , aniston was forced not to participate in several friends @-@ related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . aniston explained , \" when we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... i was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn \\'t know if i was going to be still playing rachel . \" director james burrows admitted that aniston had been cast in second position . the producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , \" i \\'m auditioning for your part in friends . \" ultimately , muddling through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes , two weeks before the pilot of friends aired , thus allowing aniston to keep her role on the show , becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25 . crane appreciated aniston \\'s interpretation of rachel because \" in the wrong hands rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable , \" commending the actress for \" breathing life into a difficult character . \" \\n  crane and kauffman strongly envisioned friends as an ensemble comedy , and warner bros. initially marketed the show as such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press , interviews and photo shoots . one of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , elizabeth kolbert of the new york times explained that each of the show \\'s main characters are \" of equal importance . \" as a writer , crane preferred it this way because \" utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . \" kauffman echoed \" that friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . \" the only reason aniston is credited first during the show \\'s title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . the show \\'s ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . famously , the friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $ 100 @,@ 000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $ 1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten – approximately $ 25 million per year . alongside cox and actress lisa kudrow , who portrays phoebe , aniston became the highest @-@ paid television actress of all time . by then , aniston had surpassed cox as the show \\'s most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the \" rachel \" and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high @-@ profile relationship with her then @-@ husband , actor brad pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . at times the producers would use the actress \\' popularity to boost the show \\'s ratings , notably her character \\'s seventh season kiss with actress winona ryder and pregnancy arc . aniston had been telling the press that the show \\'s ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to friends to film its tenth and final season . she explained to nbc \\'s matt lauer , \" i wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . and then i was also feeling like , ‘ how much more of rachel do i have in me ? ’ ” however , the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of friends , which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate aniston \\'s busy film schedule . \\n  = =

stereotype , jonathan bernstein of the daily telegraph identified rachel as \" the self @-@ absorbed one who goes from riches to rags . \" according to reign magazine , rachel is \" a human being full of vulnerability , humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure . \" originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for \" the world as an adult \" , rachel \\'s personality was gradually tailored to suit aniston as the series progressed , becoming \" more self @-@ sufficient and sympathetic . \" according to shining in the shadows : movie stars of the 2000s author murray pomerance , \" the more boundary collapsed between the \\' real \\' jennifer aniston and rachel , the more \\' authentic \\' aniston became . \" pomerance also noted that the

حصن الفرسان ) , also crac des chevaliers , ḥoṣn al @-@ akrād ( حصن الأكراد ) , castle alhsn , formerly crac de l \\'ospital , is a crusader castle in syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world . the site was first inhabited in the 11th century by a settlement of kurdish troops dispatched there by the mirdasids ; as a result it was known as hisn al @-@ akrad , meaning the \" castle of the kurds \" . in 1142 it was given by raymond ii , count of tripoli , to the knights hospitaller . it remained in their possession until it fell in 1271 . it became known as crac de l \\'ospital ; the name krak des chevaliers was coined in the 19th century . \\n  the hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle . the order controlled a number of castles along the border of the county of tripoli , a state founded after the first crusade . krak des chevaliers was among the most important , and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base . after a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century , krak des chevaliers became a concentric castle . this phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance . the first half of the century has been described as krak des chevaliers \\' \" golden age \" . at its peak , krak des chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2 @,@ 000 . such a large garrison allowed the hospitallers to extract tribute from a wide area . from the 1250s the fortunes of the knights hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 mamluk sultan baibars captured krak des chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days , supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the hospitallers \\' grand master that caused the knights to surrender . \\n  renewed interest in crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of krak des chevaliers , and architectural plans were drawn up . in the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle , causing damage to its fabric . the 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the french state , which carried out a program of clearing and restoration . when syria declared independence in 1946 , it assumed control . today , a village called al @-@ husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9 @,@ 000 . krak des chevaliers is located approximately 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) west of the city of homs , close to the border of lebanon , and is administratively part of the homs governorate . since 2006 , the castles of krak des chevaliers and qal \\'at salah el @-@ din have been recognized by unesco as a world heritage site . it was partially damaged in the syrian civil war from shelling : the full extent of the damage is unknown , but there have been reports of hasty repairs . \\n  = = etymology = = \\n  the modern arabic word for a castle is kalaa ( قلعة ) , but krak des chavaliers is known as a \" hosn \" ( حصن ) , or \" fort \" . this derives from the name of an earlier fortification on the same site called ḥoṣn al @-@ akrād ( حصن الأكراد ) , meaning \" fort of the kurds \" . it was called by the franks le crat and then by a confusion with karak ( fortress ) , le crac . crat was probably the frankish version of akrād , the word for kurds . after the knights hospitaller took control of the castle , it became known as crac de l \\'ospital ; the name crac des chevaliers ( alternatively spelt krak des chevaliers ) was introduced by guillaume rey in the 19th century . \\n  = = location = = \\n  the castle sits atop a 650 @-@ metre @-@ high ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) hill east of tartus , syria , in the homs gap . on the other side of the gap , 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) away , was the 12th @-@ century gibelacar castle . the route through the strategically important homs gap connects the cities of tripoli and homs . to the north of the castle lies the jebel ansariyah , and to the south lebanon . the surrounding area is fertile , benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall . compared to the kingdom of jerusalem , the other crusader states had less land suitable for farming ; however , the limestone peaks of tripoli were well @-@ suited to defensive sites . \\n  property in the county of tripoli , granted to the knights templar in the 1140s , included the castle of the kurds , the towns of rafanea and montferrand , and the buqai \\'ah plain separating homs and tripoli . homs was never under crusader control , so the region around the castle of the kurds was vulnerable to expeditions from the city . while its proximity caused the knights problems with regard to defending their territory , it also meant homs was close enough for them to raid . because of the castle \\'s command of the plain , it became the knights \\' most important base in the area . \\n  = = history = = \\n  according to 13th @-@ century arab historian ibn shaddad , the mirdasid emir of aleppo , shibl ad @-@ dawla , established a settlement of kurdish tribesmen at the site of the future castle in 1031 ce , hence the castle \\'s arabic name \" hisn al @-@ akrad \" ( castle of the kurds ) . the site was strategically located at the southern edge of the jibal al @-@ alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between homs and tripoli . when building castles , muslims often chose elevated sites such as hills and mountains that provided natural obstacles . \\n  in january 1099 on the journey to jerusalem during the first crusade , the company of raymond iv of toulouse came under attack from the garrison of hisn al @-@ akrad , the forerunner of the krak , who harried raymond \\'s foragers . the following day raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted . the crusaders briefly occupied the castle in february of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards jerusalem . permanent occupation began in 1110 when tancred , prince of galilee took control of the site . the early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site . \\n  the origins of the knights hospitaller are unclear , but the order probably emerged around the 1070s in jerusalem . it started as a religious order which cared for the sick , and later looked after pilgrims to the holy land . after the success of the first crusade in capturing jerusalem in 1099 , many crusaders donated their new property in the levant to the hospital of st john . early donations were in the newly formed kingdom of jerusalem , but over time the order extended its holdings to the crusader states of the county of tripoli and the principality of antioch . evidence suggests that in the 1130s the order became militarized when fulk , king of jerusalem , granted the newly built castle at bethgibelin to the order in 1136 . a papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims . there were also other military orders , such as the knights templar , which offered protection to pilgrims . \\n  between 1142 and 1144 raymond ii , count of tripoli , granted the order property in the county . according to historian jonathan riley @-@ smith , the hospitallers effectively established a \" palatinate \" within tripoli . the property included castles with which the hospitallers were expected to defend tripoli . along with krak des chevaliers , the hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state which allowed the order to dominate the area . the order \\'s agreement with raymond ii stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign , the spoils belonged entirely to the order , and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order . raymond ii could further not make peace with the muslims without the permission of the hospitallers . the hospitallers made krak des chevaliers a center of administration for their new property , undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate crusader fortifications in the levant . \\n  after acquiring the site in 1142 , they began building a new castle to replace the former kurdish fortification . this work lasted until 1170 , when an earthquake damaged the castle . an arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle \\'s chapel , which was replaced by the present chapel . in 1163 the crusaders emerged victorious over nur ad @-@ din in the battle of al @-@ buqaia near krak des chevaliers . \\n  drought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the crusaders to sign a two @-@ year truce with the muslims , but without tripoli included in the terms . during the 1180s raids by christians and muslims into each other \\'s territory became more frequent . in 1180 , saladin ventured into the county of tripoli , ravaging the area . unwilling to meet him in open battle , the crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications . without capturing the castles , saladin could not secure control of the area , and once he retreated the hospitallers were able to revitalize their damaged lands . the battle of hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the crusaders : guy of lusignan , king of jerusalem , was captured , as was the true cross , a relic discovered during the first crusade . afterwards saladin ordered the execution of the captured templar and hospitaller knights , such was the importance of the two orders in defending the crusader states . after the battle , the hospitaller castles of belmont , belvoir , and bethgibelin fell to muslim armies . following these losses , the order focused its attention on its castles in tripoli . in may 1188 saladin led an army to attack krak des chevaliers , but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the hospitaller castle of margat , which he also failed to capture . \\n  another earthquake struck in 1202 , and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled . the 13th @-@ century work was the last period of building at krak des chevaliers and gave it its current appearance . an enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170 ; the earlier structure became the castle \\'s inner court or ward . if there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre @-@ dated the current outer walls , no trace of it has been discovered . \\n  the first half of the 13th century has been characterized as krak des chevaliers \\' \" golden age \" . while other crusader strongholds came under threat , krak des chevaliers and its garrison of 2 @,@ 000 soldiers dominated the surrounding area . it was effectively the center of a principality which remained in crusader hands until 1271 and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under crusader control during this period . crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle , and probably made donations . king andrew ii of hungary visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the \" key of the christian lands \" . he was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60 marks to the master and 40 to the brothers . geoffroy de joinville , uncle of the noted chronicler of the crusades jean de joinville , died at krak des chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle \\'s chapel . \\n  the main contemporary accounts relating to krak des chevaliers are of muslim origin and tend to emphasize muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the crusaders although they suggest that the knights hospitaller forced the settlements of hama and homs to pay tribute to the order . this situation lasted as long as saladin \\'s successors warred between themselves . the proximity of krak des chevaliers to muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role , acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked . by 1203 the garrison were making raids on montferrand ( which was under muslim control ) and hama , and in 1207 and 1208 the castle \\'s soldiers took part in an attack on homs . krak des chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute . the former was unsuccessful , but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of krak des chevaliers . \\n  in the 1250s , the fortunes of the hospitallers at krak des chevaliers took a turn for the worse . a muslim army estimated to number 10 @,@ 000 men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the order \\'s finances declined sharply . in 1268 master hugh revel complained that the area , previously home to around 10 @,@ 000 people , now stood deserted and that the order \\'s property in the kingdom of jerusalem produced little income . he also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the order \\'s brethren left in the east . on the muslim side , in 1260 baibars became sultan of egypt , following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler qutuz , and went on to unite egypt and syria . as a result , muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the hospitallers at krak des chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so . \\n  baibars ventured into the area around krak des chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle . when he received news that year of the eighth crusade led by king louis ix of france , baibars left for cairo to avoid a confrontation . after louis died in 1271 baibars returned to deal with krak des chevaliers . before he marched on the castle the sultan captured the smaller castles in the area , including chastel blanc . on 3 march , baibars \\' army arrived at krak des chevaliers . by the time the sultan appeared on the scene , the castle may already have been blockaded by mamluk forces for several days . of the three arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary , that of ibn shaddad , although he was not present at the siege . peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward . as soon as baibars arrived he erected mangonels , powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle . in a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle \\'s entrance , ibn shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers . \\n  rain interrupted the siege , but on 21 march , immediately south of krak des chevaliers , baibar \\'s forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade . on 29 march , the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner causing it to collapse whereupon baibars \\' army attacked through the breach . in the outer ward they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle . though the outer ward had fallen , with a handful of the garrison killed in the process , the crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward . after a lull of ten days , the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison , supposedly from the grand master of the knights hospitaller in tripoli , which granted permission for them to surrender . although the letter was a forgery , the garrison capitulated and the sultan spared their lives . the new owners of the castle undertook repairs , focused mainly on the outer ward . the hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs were added to the interior . \\n  = = later history = = \\n  after the franks were driven from the holy land in 1291 , european familiarity with the castles of the crusades declined . it was not until the 19th century that interest in these buildings was renewed , so there are no detailed plans from before 1837 . guillaume rey was the first european researcher to scientifically study crusader castles in the holy land . in 1871 he published the work etudes sur les monuments de l \\'architecture militaire des croisés en syrie et dans l \\'ile de chypre ; it included plans and drawings of the major crusader castles in syria , including krak des chevaliers . in some instances his drawings were inaccurate , however for krak des chavaliers they record features which have since been lost . \\n  paul deschamps visited the castle in february 1927 . since rey had visited in the 19th century a village of 500 people had been established within the castle . renewed inhabitation had damaged the site : underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed . deschamps and fellow architect françois anus attempted to clear some of the detritus ; general maurice gamelin assigned 60 alawite soldiers to help . deschamps left in march 1927 , and work resumed when he returned two years later . the culmination of deschamp \\'s work at the castle was the publication of les châteaux des croisés en terre sainte i : le crac des chevaliers in 1934 , with detailed plans by anus . the survey has been widely praised , described as \" brilliant and exhaustive \" by military historian d. j. cathcart king in 1949 and \" perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written \" by historian hugh kennedy in 1994 . \\n  as early as 1929 there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under french control . on 16 november 1933 krak des chevaliers was given into the control of the french state , and cared for by the académie des beaux @-@ arts . the villagers were moved and paid f1 million between them in compensation . over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120 workers . once finished , krak des chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the french levant . pierre coupel , who had undertaken similar work at the tower of the lions and the two castles at sidon , supervized the work . despite the restoration , no archaeological excavations were carried out . the french mandate of syria and lebanon , which had been established in 1920 , ended in 1946 with the declaration of syrian independence . the castle was made a world heritage site by unesco , along with qal ’ at salah el @-@ din , in 2006 , and is owned by the syrian government . \\n  several of the castle \\'s former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al @-@ husn has since developed . many of the al @-@ husn \\'s roughly 9 @,@ 000 muslim residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site . \\n  = = = syrian civil war = = = \\n  during the syrian civil war which began in 2011 , unesco voiced concerns that the war might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as krak des chevaliers . it has been reported that the castle was shelled in august 2012 by the syrian arab army , and the crusader chapel has been damaged . the castle was reported to have been damaged in july 2013 by an airstrike during the siege of homs , and once more on the 18th of august 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown . the syrian arab army recaptured the castle and the village of al @-@ hosn from rebel forces on march 20 , 2014 , although the extent of damage from earlier mortar hits remained unclear . \\n  = = architecture = = \\n  writing in the early 20th century , t. e. lawrence , popularly known as lawrence of arabia , remarked that krak des chevaliers was \" perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world , [ a castle which ] forms a fitting commentary on any account of the crusading buildings of syria \" . castles in europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration ; in the levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design . kennedy suggests that \" the castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like margat and crac des chevaliers . \" \\n  krak des chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle , due to its site , and after the 13th @-@ century expansion a fully developed concentric castle . it was similar in size and layout to vadum jacob , a crusader castle built in the late 1170s . margat has also been cited as krak des chevaliers \\' sister castle . the main building material at krak des chevaliers was limestone ; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable . outside the castle \\'s entrance was a \" walled suburb \" known as a burgus , no trace of which remains . to the south of the outer ward was a triangular outwork and the crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it . it is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege , though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade . south of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill , so that siege engines can approach on level ground . the inner defences are strongest at this point , with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall . \\n  = = = inner ward = = = \\n  between 1142 and 1170 the knights hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site . the castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly . the main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side , and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower . at the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers . the lay of the land dictated the castle \\'s irregular shape . a site with natural defences was a typical location for crusader castles and steep slopes provided krak des chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one , where the castle \\'s defences were concentrated . this phase of building was incorporated into the later castle \\'s construction . \\n  when krak des chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th century , new walls surrounding the inner court were built . they followed the earlier walls , with a narrow gap between them in the west and south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles . in this area , the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes . four large , round towers project vertically from the glacis ; they were used as accommodation for the knights of the garrison , about 60 at its peak . the southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the grand master of the knights hospitaller . though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places , it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit . machicolations were absent from the southern face . the area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation . in the east , where the defences were weakest , there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct . it acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle . \\n  at the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade . the esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard ; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles . lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the knights . though probably first built in the 12th century , the interior dates from the 13th @-@ century remodelling . the tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of gothic architecture , probably dating from the 1230s . \\n  = = = chapel = = = \\n  the current chapel was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170 . only the east end of the original chapel , which housed the apse , and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel . the later chapel had a barrel vault and an uncomplicated apse ; its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in france , but bears similarities to that built around 1186 at margat . it was divided into three roughly equal bays . a cornice runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins . oriented roughly east to west , it was 21 @.@ 5 metres ( 71 ft ) long and 8 @.@ 5 metres ( 28 ft ) wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall . when the castle was remodelled in the early 13th century , the entrance was moved to the south wall . the chapel was lit by windows above the cornice , one at the west end , one on either side of the east bay , and one on the south side of the central bay , and the apse at the east end had a large window . in 1935 a second chapel was discovered outside the castle \\'s main entrance , however it no longer survives . \\n  = = = outer ward = = = \\n  the second phase of building work undertaken by the hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades . the outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site , lending the krak des chevaliers its current appearance . standing 9 metres ( 30 ft ) high , the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall . while the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall , the towers of the 13th @-@ century outer walls were rounded . this design was new and even contemporary templar castles did not have rounded towers . the technique was developed at château gaillard in france by richard the lionheart between 1196 and 1198 . the extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date . probably around the 1250s a postern was added to the north wall . \\n  arrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimize the amount of dead ground around the castle . machicolations crowned the walls , offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall . they were so cramped archers would have had to crouch inside them . the box machicolations were unusual : those at krak des chevaliers were more complex that those at saône or margat and there were no comparable features amongst crusader castles . however , they bore similarities to muslim work , such as the contemporary defences at the citadel of aleppo . it is unclear which side imitated the other , as the date they were added to krak des chevaliers is unknown , but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the muslim and christian armies . these defences were accessed by a wall @-@ walk known as a chemin de ronde . in the opinion of historian hugh kennedy the defences of the outer wall were \" the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the latin east ... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine \" . \\n  when the outer walls were built in the 13th century the main entrance was enhanced . a vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast . the corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length , making it an example of a bent entrance . bent entrances were a byzantine innovation , but that at krak des chevaliers was a particularly complex example . it extended for 137 metres ( 450 ft ) , and along its length were murder @-@ holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles . anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle \\'s two circuits of walls . to access the inner ward , the passage had to be followed round . \\n  = = = frescoes = = = \\n  despite its predominantly military character , the castle is one of the few sites where crusader art ( in the form of frescoes ) has been preserved . in 1935 , 1955 , and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within krak des chevaliers after later plaster and white @-@ wash had decayed . the frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance , which no longer survives . writing in 1982 , historian jaroslav folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at krak des chevaliers . those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170 – 1202 rebuild . mold , smoke , and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes . the fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess . the one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the presentation of jesus at the temple . \\n  = the importance of being earnest = \\n  the importance of being earnest , a trivial comedy for serious people is a play by oscar wilde . first performed on 14 february 1895 at the st james \\'s theatre in london , it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations . working within the social conventions of late victorian london , the play \\'s major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage , and the resulting satire of victorian ways . contemporary reviews all praised the play \\'s humour , though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages , while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of wilde \\'s artistic career so far . its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make the importance of being earnest wilde \\'s most enduringly popular play . \\n  the successful opening night marked the climax of wilde \\'s career but also heralded his downfall . the marquess of queensberry , whose son lord alfred douglas was wilde \\'s lover , planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show . wilde was tipped off and queensberry was refused admission . soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court , where wilde \\'s homosexual double life was revealed to the victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment . his notoriety caused the play , despite its early success , to be closed after 86 performances . after his release , he published the play from exile in paris , but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work . \\n  the importance of being earnest has been revived many times since its premiere . it has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions . in the importance of being earnest ( 1952 ) , dame edith evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of lady bracknell ; the importance of being earnest ( 1992 ) by kurt baker used an all @-@ black cast ; and oliver parker \\'s the importance of being earnest ( 2002 ) incorporated some of wilde \\'s original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production . \\n  = = composition = = \\n  after the success of wilde \\'s plays lady windermere \\'s fan and a woman of no importance , wilde \\'s producers urged him to write further plays . in july 1894 he mooted his idea for the importance of being earnest to george alexander , the actor @-@ manager of the st james \\'s theatre . wilde spent the summer with his family at worthing , where he wrote the play quickly in august . his fame now at its peak , he used the working title lady lancing to avoid pre @-@ emptive speculation of its content . many names and ideas in the play were borrowed from people or places the author had known ; lady queensberry , lord alfred douglas \\'s mother , for example , lived at bracknell . there is widespread agreement among wilde scholars that the most important influence on the play was w. s. gilbert \\'s 1877 farce engaged ; wilde borrowed from gilbert not only several incidents but , in russell jackson \\'s phrase \" the gravity of tone demanded by gilbert of his actors \" . \\n  wilde continually revised the text over the next months : no line was left untouched , and \" in a play so economical with its language and effects , [ the revisions ] had serious consequences \" . sos eltis describes wilde \\'s revisions as a refined art at work : the earliest , longest handwritten drafts of the play labour over farcical incidents , broad puns , nonsense dialogue and conventional comic turns . in revising as he did , \" wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systemic and disconcerting illogicality which characterises earnest \\'s dialogue \" . richard ellmann argues that wilde had reached his artistic maturity and wrote this work more surely and rapidly than before . \\n  wilde hesitated about submitting the script to alexander , worrying that it might be unsuitable for the st james \\'s theatre , whose typical repertoire was relatively serious , and explaining that it had been written in response to a request for a play \" with no real serious interest \" . when henry james \\'s guy domville failed , alexander turned to wilde and agreed to put on his play . alexander began his usual meticulous preparations , interrogating the author on each line and planning stage movements with a toy theatre . in the course of these rehearsals alexander asked wilde to shorten the play from four acts to three . wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts . the largest cut was the removal of the character of mr. gribsby , a solicitor who comes from london to arrest the profligate \" ernest \" ( i.e. , jack ) for his unpaid dining bills . algernon , who is posing as \" ernest \" , will be led away to holloway jail unless he settles his accounts immediately . jack finally agrees to pay for ernest , everyone thinking that it is algernon \\'s bill when in fact it is his own . the four @-@ act version was first played on the radio in a bbc production and is still sometimes performed . peter raby argues that the three @-@ act structure is more effective , and that the shorter original text is more theatrically resonant than the expanded published edition . \\n  = = productions = = \\n  = = = premiere = = = \\n  the play was first produced at the st james \\'s theatre on valentine \\'s day 1895 . it was freezing cold but wilde arrived dressed in \" florid sobriety \" , wearing a green carnation . the audience , according to one report , \" included many members of the great and good , former cabinet ministers and privy councillors , as well as actors , writers , academics , and enthusiasts \" . allan aynesworth , who played algernon moncrieff , recalled to hesketh pearson that \" in my fifty @-@ three years of acting , i never remember a greater triumph than [ that ] first night \" . aynesworth was himself \" debonair and stylish \" , and alexander , who played jack worthing , \" demure \" . \\n  the cast was : \\n  john worthing , j.p. — george alexander \\n  algernon moncrieff — allan aynesworth \\n  rev. canon chasuble , d.d. — h.

— mrs. george canninge \\n  the marquess of queensberry , the father of wilde \\'s lover lord alfred douglas ( who was on holiday in algiers at the time ) , had planned to disrupt the play by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end of the show . wilde and alexander learned of the plan , and the latter cancelled queensberry \\'s ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance . nevertheless , he continued harassing wilde , who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel , triggering a series of trials ending in wilde \\'s imprisonment for gross indecency . alexander tried , unsuccessfully , to save the production by removing wilde \\'s name from the billing , but the play had to close after only 86 performances . \\n  the play \\'s original broadway production opened at the empire theatre on 22 april 1895 , but closed after sixteen performances . its cast included william faversham as algy , henry miller as jack , viola allen as gwendolen , and ida vernon as lady bracknell . the australian premiere was in melbourne on 10 august 1895 , presented by dion boucicault , jr. and robert brough , and the play was an immediate success . wilde \\'s downfall in england did not affect the popularity of his plays in australia . \\n  = = = critical reception = = = \\n  in contrast to much theatre of the time , the importance of being earnest \\'s light plot does not tackle serious social and political issues , something of which contemporary reviewers were wary . though unsure of wilde \\'s seriousness as a dramatist , they recognised the play \\'s cleverness , humour and popularity with audiences . george bernard shaw , for example , reviewed the play in the saturday review , arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse , \" i go to the theatre to be moved to laughter . \" later in a letter he said , the play , though \" extremely funny \" , was wilde \\'s \" first really heartless [ one ] \" . in the world , william archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning , \" what can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle , whether of art or morals , creates its own canons and conventions , and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality ? \" \\n  in the speaker , a. b. walkley admired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of wilde \\'s dramatic career . he denied the term \" farce \" was derogatory , or even lacking in seriousness , and said \" it is of nonsense all compact , and better nonsense , i think , our stage has not seen . \" h. g. wells , in an unsigned review for the pall mall gazette , called earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year , saying \" more humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine . \" he also questioned whether people would fully see its message , \" ... how serious people will take this trivial comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen . no doubt seriously . \" the play was so light @-@ hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama . w. h. auden later called it \" a pure verbal opera \" , and the times commented , \" the story is almost too preposterous to go without music . \" mary mccarthy , in sights and spectacles ( 1959 ) , however , and despite thinking the play extremely funny , would call it \" a ferocious idyll \" ; \" depravity is the hero and the only character . \" \\n  the importance of being earnest is wilde \\'s most popular work and is continually revived . max beerbohm called the play wilde \\'s \" finest , most undeniably his own \" , saying that in his other comedies — lady windermere \\'s fan , a woman of no importance and an ideal husband — the plot , following the manner of victorien sardou , is unrelated to the theme of the work , while in earnest the story is \" dissolved \" into the form of the play . \\n  = = = revivals = = = \\n  until after wilde \\'s death in 1900 his name remained disgraced , and few discussed , let alone performed , his work in britain . alexander revived the importance in a small theatre in notting hill , outside the west end , in 1901 ; in the same year he presented the piece on tour , playing jack worthing with a cast including the young lilian braithwaite as cecily . the play returned to the west end when alexander presented a revival at the st james \\'s in 1902 . broadway revivals were mounted in 1902 and again in 1910 , each production running for six weeks . \\n  a collected edition of wilde \\'s works , published in 1908 and edited by robert ross , helped to restore his reputation as an author . alexander presented another revival of the importance at the st james \\'s in 1909 , when he and aynesworth reprised their original roles ; the revival ran for 316 performances . max beerbohm said that the play was sure to become a classic of the english repertory , and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written , adding that the actors had \" worn as well as the play \" . \\n  for a 1913 revival at the same theatre the young actors gerald ames and a. e. matthews succeeded the creators as jack and algy . john deverell as jack and margaret scudamore as lady bracknell headed the cast in a 1923 production at the haymarket theatre . many revivals in the first decades of the 20th century treated \" the present \" as the current year . it was not until the 1920s that the case for 1890s costumes was established ; as a critic in the manchester guardian put it , \" thirty years on , one begins to feel that wilde should be done in the costume of his period — that his wit today needs the backing of the atmosphere that gave it life and truth . … wilde \\'s glittering and complex verbal felicities go ill with the shingle and the short skirt . \" \\n  in sir nigel playfair \\'s 1930 production at the lyric , hammersmith , john gielgud played jack to the lady bracknell of his aunt , mabel terry @-@ lewis . gielgud produced and starred in a production at the globe ( now the gielgud ) theatre in 1939 , in a cast that included edith evans as lady bracknell , joyce carey as gwendolen , angela baddeley as cecily and margaret rutherford as miss prism . the times considered the production the best since the original , and praised it for its fidelity to wilde \\'s conception , its \" airy , responsive ball @-@ playing quality . \" later in the same year gielgud presented the work again , with jack hawkins as algy , gwen ffrangcon @-@ davies as gwendolen and peggy ashcroft as cecily , with evans and rutherford in their previous roles . the production was presented in several seasons during and after the second world war , with mostly the same main players . during a 1946 season at the haymarket the king and queen attended a performance , which , as the journalist geoffrey wheatcroft put it , gave the play \" a final accolade of respectability . \" the production toured north america , and was successfully staged on broadway in 1947 . \\n  as wilde \\'s work came to be read and performed again , it was the importance of being earnest that received the most productions . by the time of its centenary the journalist mark lawson described it as \" the second most known and quoted play in english after hamlet . \" \\n  for sir peter hall \\'s 1982 production at the national theatre the cast included judi dench as lady bracknell , martin jarvis as jack , nigel havers as algy , zoë wanamaker as gwendolen and anna massey as miss prism . nicholas hytner \\'s 1993 production at the aldwych theatre , starring maggie smith , had occasional references to the supposed gay subtext . \\n  in 2005 the abbey theatre , dublin , produced the play with an all @-@ male cast ; it also featured wilde as a character — the play opens with him drinking in a parisian café , dreaming of his play . the melbourne theatre company staged a production in december 2011 with geoffrey rush as lady bracknell . \\n  in 2011 the roundabout theatre company produced a broadway revival based on the 2009 stratford shakespeare festival production featuring brian bedford as director and as lady bracknell . it opened at the american airlines theatre on 13 january and ran until 3 july 2011 . the cast also included dana ivey as miss prism , paxton whitehead as canon chasuble , santino fontana as algernon , paul o \\'brien as lane , charlotte parry as cecily , david furr as jack and sara topham as gwendolen . it was nominated for three tony awards . \\n  the play was also presented internationally , in singapore , in october 2004 , by the british theatre playhouse , and the same company brought it to london \\'s greenwich theatre in april 2005 . \\n  = = synopsis = = \\n  the play is set in \" the present \" ( i.e. 1895 ) . \\n  = = = act i = = = \\n  algernon moncrieff \\'s flat in half moon street , w \\n  the play opens with algernon moncrieff , an idle young gentleman , receiving his best friend , john worthing , whom he knows as ernest . ernest has come from the country to propose to algernon \\'s cousin , gwendolen fairfax . algernon , however , refuses his consent until ernest explains why his cigarette case bears the inscription , \" from little cecily , with her fondest love to her dear uncle jack . \" \\' ernest \\' is forced to admit to living a double life . in the country , he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward , the heiress cecily cardew , and goes by the name of john ( or , as a nickname , jack ) , while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother named ernest in london . in the city , meanwhile , he assumes the identity of the libertine ernest . algernon confesses a similar deception : he pretends to have an invalid friend named bunbury in the country , whom he can \" visit \" whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation . jack refuses to tell algernon the location of his country estate . \\n  gwendolen and her formidable mother lady bracknell now call on algernon who distracts lady bracknell in another room while jack proposes to gwendolen . she accepts , but seems to love him very largely for his professed name of ernest . jack accordingly resolves to himself to be rechristened \" ernest \" . discovering them in this intimate exchange , lady bracknell interviews jack as a prospective suitor . horrified to learn that he was adopted after being discovered as a baby in a handbag at victoria station , she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter . gwendolen , though , manages covertly to promise to him her undying love . as jack gives her his address in the country , algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve : jack \\'s revelation of his pretty and wealthy young ward has motivated his friend to meet her . \\n  = = = act

therefore , algernon , too , plans for the rector , dr. chasuble , to rechristen him \" ernest \" . \\n  jack , meanwhile , has decided to abandon his double life . he arrives in full mourning and announces his brother \\'s death in paris of a severe chill , a story undermined by algernon \\'s presence in the guise of ernest . \\n  gwendolen now enters , having run away from home . during the

only if lady bracknell agrees to his own union with gwendolen — something she declines to do . \\n  the impasse is broken by the return of miss prism , whom lady bracknell recognises as the person who , twenty @-@ eight years earlier , as a family nursemaid , had taken a baby boy for a walk in a perambulator ( baby carriage ) and never returned . challenged , miss prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator , and the baby in a handbag , which she had left at victoria station . jack produces the very same handbag , showing that he is the lost baby , the elder son of lady bracknell \\'s late sister , and thus indeed algernon \\'s elder brother . having acquired such respectable relations , he is acceptable as a suitor for gwendolen after all . \\n  gwendolen , though , still insists that she can only love a man named ernest . what is her fiancé \\'s real first name ? lady bracknell informs jack that , as the first @-@ born , he would have been named after his father , general moncrieff . jack examines the army lists and discovers that his father \\'s name — and hence his own real name — was in fact ernest . pretence was reality all along . as the happy couples embrace — jack and gwendolen , algernon and cecily , and even dr. chasuble and miss prism — lady bracknell complains to her newfound relative : \" my nephew , you seem to be displaying signs of triviality . \" \" on the contrary , aunt augusta \" , he replies , \" i \\'ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital importance of being earnest . \" \\n  = = themes = = \\n  = = = triviality = = = \\n  arthur ransome described the importance ... as the most trivial of wilde \\'s society plays , and the only one that produces \" that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful . \" \" it is \" , he wrote , \" precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly . \" ellmann says that the importance of being earnest touched on many themes wilde had been building since the 1880s — the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and wilde takes it as a starting point for the two protagonists . while salome , an ideal husband and the picture of dorian gray had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing , vice in earnest is represented by algy \\'s craving for cucumber sandwiches . wilde told robert ross that the play \\'s theme was \" that we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously , and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality . \" the theme is hinted at in the play \\'s ironic title , and \" earnestness \" is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue , algernon says in act ii , \" one has to be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life \" but goes on to reproach jack for \\' being serious about everything \\' \" . blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of dorian gray and sir robert chiltern ( in an ideal husband ) , but in earnest the protagonists \\' duplicity ( algernon \\'s \" bunburying \" and worthing \\'s double life as jack and ernest ) is undertaken for more innocent purposes — largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations . while much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues , earnest is superficially about nothing at all . it \" refuses to play the game \" of other dramatists of the period , for instance bernard shaw , who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals . \\n  = = = as a satire of society = = = \\n  the play repeatedly mocks victorian traditions and social customs , marriage and the pursuit of love in particular . in victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over @-@ riding societal value , originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes , it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century . the play \\'s very title , with its mocking paradox ( serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies ) , introduces the theme , it continues in the drawing room discussion , \" yes , but you must be serious about it . i hate people who are not serious about meals . it is so shallow of them , \" says algernon in act 1 ; allusions are quick and from multiple angles . \\n  wilde managed both to engage with and to mock the genre , while providing social commentary and offering reform . the men follow traditional matrimonial rites , whereby suitors admit their weaknesses to their prospective brides , but the foibles they excuse are ridiculous , and the farce is built on an absurd confusion of a book and a baby . when jack apologises to gwendolen during his marriage proposal it is for not being wicked : \\n  jack : gwendolen , it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth . can you forgive me ? \\n  gwendolen : i can . for i feel that you are sure to change . \\n  in turn , both gwendolen and cecily have the ideal of marrying a man named ernest , a popular and respected name at the time . gwendolen , quite unlike her mother \\'s methodical analysis of john worthing \\'s suitability as a husband , places her entire faith in a christian name , declaring in act i , \" the only really safe name is ernest \" . this is an opinion shared by cecily in act ii , \" i pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called ernest \" and they indignantly declare that they have been deceived when they find out the men \\'s real names . \\n  wilde embodied society \\'s rules and rituals artfully into lady bracknell : minute attention to the details of her style created a comic effect of assertion by restraint . in contrast to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the social distinctions of london \\'s street names , jack \\'s obscure parentage is subtly evoked . he defends himself against her \" a handbag ? \" with the clarification , \" the brighton line \" . at the time , victoria station consisted of two separate but adjacent terminal stations sharing the same name . to the east was the ramshackle lc & d railway , on the west the up @-@ market lb & scr — the brighton line , which went to worthing , the fashionable , expensive town the gentleman who found baby jack was travelling to at the time ( and after which jack was named ) . \\n  = = = suggested homosexual subtext = = = \\n  it has been argued that the play \\'s themes of duplicity and ambivalence are inextricably bound up with wilde \\'s homosexuality , and that the play exhibits a \" flickering presence @-@ absence of … homosexual desire \" . on re @-@ reading the play after his release from prison , wilde said : \" it was extraordinary reading the play over . how i used to toy with that tiger life . \" as one scholar has put it , the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to \" need a public mask is a factor contributing to the satire on social disguise . \" \\n  the use of the name earnest may have been a homosexual in @-@ joke . in 1892 , three years before wilde wrote the play , john gambril nicholson had published the book of pederastic poetry love in earnest . the sonnet of boys \\' names included the verse : \" though frank may ring like silver bell / and cecil softer music claim / they cannot work the miracle / – \\' tis ernest sets my heart a @-@ flame . \" the word \" earnest \" may also have been a code @-@ word for homosexual , as in : \" is he earnest ? \" , in the same way that \" is he so ? \" and \" is he musical ? \" were employed . \\n  sir donald sinden , an actor who had met two of the play \\'s original cast ( irene vanbrugh and allan aynesworth ) , and lord alfred douglas , wrote to the times to dispute suggestions that \" earnest \" held any sexual connotations : \\n  although they had ample opportunity , at no time did any of them even hint that \" earnest \" was a synonym for homosexual , or that \" bunburying \" may have implied homosexual sex . the first time i heard it mentioned was in the 1980s and i immediately consulted sir john gielgud whose own performance of jack worthing in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic . he replied in his ringing tones : \" no @-@ no ! nonsense , absolute nonsense : i would have known \" . \\n  a number of theories have also been put forward to explain the derivation of bunbury , and bunburying , which are used in the play to imply a secretive double life . it may have derived from henry shirley bunbury , a hypochondriacal acquaintance of wilde \\'s youth . another suggestion , put forward in 1913 by aleister crowley , who knew wilde , was that bunbury was a combination word : that wilde had once taken train to banbury , met a schoolboy there , and arranged a second secret meeting with him at sunbury . \\n  = = dramatic analysis = = \\n  = = = use of language = = = \\n  while wilde had long been famous for dialogue and his use of language , raby ( 1988 ) argues that he achieved a unity and mastery in earnest that was unmatched in his other plays , except perhaps salomé . while his earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious , earnest achieves a pitch @-@ perfect style that allows these to dissolve . there are three different registers detectable in the play . the dandyish insouciance of jack and algernon — established early with algernon \\'s exchange with his manservant — betrays an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes . the formidable pronouncements of lady bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions . in contrast , the speech of dr. chasuble and miss prism is distinguished by \" pedantic precept \" and \" idiosyncratic diversion \" . furthermore , the play is full of epigrams and paradoxes . max beerbohm described it as littered with \" chiselled apophthegms — witticisms unrelated to action or character \" , of which he found half a dozen to be of the highest order . \\n  lady bracknell \\'s line , \" a handbag ? \" , has been called one of the most malleable in english drama , lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled . edith evans , both on stage and in the 1952 film , delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror , incredulity and condescension . stockard channing , in the gaiety theatre , dublin in 2010 , hushed the line , in a critic \\'s words , \" with a barely audible \\' a handbag ? \\' , rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath . an understated take , to be sure , but with such a well @-@ known play , packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own , it \\'s the little things that make a difference . \" \\n  = = = characterisation = = = \\n  though wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar — the dandy lord , the overbearing matriarch , the woman with a past , the puritan young lady — his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies . lady bracknell , for instance , embodies respectable , upper @-@ class society , but eltis notes how her development \" from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character \" can be traced through wilde \\'s revisions of the play . for the two young men , wilde presents not stereotypical stage \" dudes \" but intelligent beings who , as jackson puts it , \" speak like their creator in well @-@ formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue @-@ words \" . dr chasuble and miss prism are characterised by a few light touches of detail , their old @-@ fashioned enthusiasms , and the canon \\'s fastidious pedantry , pared down by wilde during his many redrafts of the text . \\n  = = = structure and genre = = = \\n  ransome argues that wilde freed himself by abandoning the melodrama , the basic structure which underlies his earlier social comedies , and basing the story entirely on the earnest / ernest verbal conceit . now freed from \" living up to any drama more serious than conversation \" wilde could now amuse himself to a fuller extent with quips , bons @-@ mots , epigrams and repartee that really had little to do with the business at hand . \\n  the genre of the importance of being earnest has been deeply debated by scholars and critics alike who have placed the play within a wide variety of genres ranging from parody to satire . in his critique of wilde , foster argues that the play creates a world where “ real values are inverted [ and ] , reason and unreason are interchanged \" . similarly , wilde \\'s use of dialogue mocks the upper classes of victorian england lending the play a satirical tone . reinhart further stipulates that the use of farcical humour to mock the upper classes \" merits the play both as satire and as drama \" . \\n  = = publication = = \\n  = = = first edition = = = \\n  wilde \\'s two final comedies , an ideal husband and the importance of being earnest , were still on stage in london at the time of his prosecution , and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public . after two years in prison with hard labour , wilde went into exile in paris , sick and depressed , his reputation destroyed in england . in 1898 , when no @-@ one else would , leonard smithers agreed with wilde to publish the two final plays . wilde proved to be a diligent reviser , sending detailed instructions on stage directions , character listings and the presentation of the book , and insisting that a playbill from the first performance be reproduced inside . ellmann argues that the proofs show a man \" very much in command of himself and of the play \" . wilde \\'s name did not appear on the cover , it was \" by the author of lady windermere \\'s fan \" . his return to work was brief though , as he refused to write anything else , \" i can write , but have lost the joy of writing \" . \\n  on 19 october 2007 , a first edition ( number 349 of 1 @,@ 000 ) was discovered inside a handbag in an oxfam shop in nantwich , cheshire . staff were unable to trace the donor . it was sold for £ 650 . \\n  = = = in translation = = = \\n  the importance of being earnest \\'s popularity has meant it has been translated into many languages , though the homophonous pun in the title ( \" ernest \" , a masculine proper name , and \" earnest \" , the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness ) poses a special problem for translators . the easiest case of a suitable translation of the pun , perpetuating its sense and meaning , may have been its translation into german . since english and german are closely related languages , german provides an equivalent adjective ( \" ernst \" ) and also a matching masculine proper name ( \" ernst \" ) . the meaning and tenor of the wordplay are exactly the same . yet there are many different possible titles in german , mostly concerning sentence structure . the two most common ones are \" bunbury oder ernst / ernst sein ist alles \" and \" bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist , ernst / ernst zu sein \" . in a study of italian translations , adrian pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles . since wordplay is often unique to the language in question , translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original — in this case the english adjective and virtue earnest — or creating a similar pun in their own language . \\n  four main strategies have been used by translators . the first leaves all characters \\' names unchanged and in their original spelling : thus the name is respected and readers reminded of the original cultural setting , but the liveliness of the pun is lost . eva malagoli varied this source @-@ oriented approach by using both the english christian names and the adjective earnest , thus preserving the pun and the english character of the play , but possibly straining an italian reader . a third group of translators replaced ernest with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language , favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original . for instance , in italian , these versions variously call the play l \\'importanza di essere franco / severo / fedele , the given names being respectively the values of honesty , propriety , and loyalty . french offers a closer pun : \" constant \" is both a first name and the quality of steadfastness , so the play is commonly known as de l \\'importance d \\'être constant , though jean anouilh translated the play under the title : il est important d \\'être aimé ( \" aimé \" is a name which also means \" beloved \" ) . these translators differ in their attitude to the original english honorific titles , some change them all , or none , but most leave a mix partially as a compensation for the added loss of englishness . lastly , one translation gave the name an italianate touch by rendering it as ernesto ; this work liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages . \\n  = = adaptations = = \\n  = = =

mathews joined the royal navy as a cadet at the age of 13 and progressed through the ranks to lieutenant . he was involved with the third anglo @-@ ashanti war of 1873 – 4 , afterwards being stationed in east africa for the suppression of the slave trade . in 1877 he was seconded from the navy to sultan barghash of zanzibar in order to form a european @-@ style army ; he would remain in the employment of the government of zanzibar for the rest of his life . his army quickly reached 6 @,@ 300 men and was used in several expeditions to suppress the slave trade and rebellions against the zanzibar government . \\n  mathews retired from the royal navy in 1881 and was appointed brigadier @-@ general of zanzibar . there followed more expeditions to the african mainland , including a failed attempt to stop german expansion in east africa . in october 1891 mathews was appointed first minister to the zanzibar government , a position in which he was \" irremovable by the sultan \" . during this time mathews was a keen abolitionist and promoted this cause to the sultans he worked with . this resulted in the prohibiting of the slave trade in zanzibar \\'s dominions in 1890 and the abolition of slavery in 1897 . mathews was appointed the british consul @-@ general for east africa in 1891 but declined to take up the position , remaining in zanzibar instead . mathews and his troops also played a key role in the ending of the anglo @-@ zanzibar war of 1896 which erupted out of an attempt to bypass the requirement that new sultans must be vetted by the british consul . during his time as first minister mathews continued to be involved with the military and was part of two large campaigns , one to witu and another to mwele . \\n  mathews was decorated by several governments , receiving appointments as a companion of the order of st michael and st george , companion of the order of the bath and as a knight commander of the order of st michael and st george from the british government and membership in the prussian order of the crown . zanzibar also rewarded him and he was a member of the grand order of hamondieh and a first class member of the order of the brilliant star of zanzibar . mathews died of malaria in zanzibar on 11 october 1901 . \\n  = = early life and career = = \\n  mathews was born at funchal on madeira on 7 march 1850 . his father , captain william matthews was welsh , and his mother jane wallis penfold , was the daughter of william penfold and sarah gilbert . her sister , augusta jane robley née penfold was the author of a famous book about the flora and fauna of madeira , which is now in the natural history museum . mathews became a cadet of the royal navy in 1863 and was appointed a midshipman on 23 september 1866 . from 1868 he was stationed in the mediterranean but his first active service was during the third anglo @-@ ashanti war of 1873 – 4 where he qualified for the campaign medal . he was promoted to lieutenant on 31 march 1874 . on 27 august 1875 mathews was posted to hms london , a depot ship and the royal navy headquarters for east africa , to assist in the suppression of the slave trade in the area . whilst onboard he drilled his own troops , captured several slave dhows and was commended for his actions by the admiralty . \\n  = = commander in chief of zanzibar = = \\n  in august 1877 , mathews was seconded from the navy to sultan barghash of zanzibar to form a european @-@ style army which could be used to enforce zanzibar \\'s control over its mainland possessions . the army had traditionally been composed entirely of arabs and persians but mathews opened up recruitment to the african majority on the island and had 300 recruits in training by the end of the year . in addition , mathews employed some unorthodox recruitment methods such as purchasing slaves from their masters , using inmates from the prison and recruiting from africans rescued from the slavers . in june 1877 , at the instigation of john kirk , the explorer and friend of the sultan , the british government sent a shipment of 500 modern rifles and ammunition as a gift with which to arm the troops . mathews introduced a new uniform for the troops consisting of a red cap , short black jackets and white trousers for the enlisted ranks and dark blue frock coats and trousers with gold and silver lace for the arab officers . the latter was possibly modelled on the royal navy officers uniform with which he was familiar . the army grew quickly ; by the 1880s mathews would command 1 @,@ 300 men , his forces eventually numbering 1 @,@ 000 regulars and 5 @,@ 000 irregulars . \\n  one of the first tasks for the new army was to suppress the smuggling of slaves from pangani on the mainland to the island of pemba , north of zanzibar . the troops completed this mission , capturing several slavers and hindering the trade . mathews retired from the royal navy in june 1881 and was appointed brigadier @-@ general of zanzibar . in 1880 , the sultan dispatched a military force under mathews to bring his unruly african mainland territories under control . mathews \\' expedition was initially intended to reach unyanyembe but his men refused to march inland and , when made to do so , deserted in large numbers . the expedition ended instead at mamboya where a 60 @-@ man garrison was established . this had been reduced to a mere handful of men by the mid @-@ 1880s but the expedition proved that the sultan was serious about maintaining control of all of his possessions . mathews \\' men were also involved in several expeditions to halt the land @-@ based slave trade which had developed once the seas became too heavily policed for the traders . \\n  in 1881 mathews \\' old vessel , the hms london , was captained by charles j brownrigg . this vessel and her crew made several patrols aimed at hindering the slave trade using smaller steam boats for the actual pursuits and captures . on december 3 , 1881 , they caught up with a slave dhow captained by hindi bin hattam . this dhow had around 100 slaves on board and was transporting them between pemba and zanzibar . captain brownrigg led a boarding party to release the slaves but bin hattam \\'s men then attacked the sailors , killing brownrigg and his party before sailing away . mathews led a force to wete on pemba and , after a short battle , took a mortally wounded bin hattem prisoner before returning to zanzibar . \\n  mathews returned to the african mainland territories once more in 1884 when he landed with a force which intended to establish further garrisons there to dissuade german territorial claims . this attempt ultimately failed when five german warships steamed into zanzibar town harbour and threatened the sultan into signing away the territories which would later form german east africa . further territories were ceded to the german east africa company in 1888 but unrest amongst the locals against them prevented them from taking control and mathews was dispatched with 100 men to restore order . finding around 8 @,@ 000 people gathered against the german administrators mathews was forced to return with his men to zanzibar . he landed once again with more troops but found himself subject to death threats and that his troops would not obey his orders and so returned again to zanzibar . \\n  = = first minister = = \\n  in october 1891 , upon the formation of the first constitutional government in zanzibar , mathews was appointed first minister , despite some hostility from sultan ali bin said . in this capacity mathews was \" irremovable by the sultan \" and answerable only to the sultan and the british consul . his position was so strong that one missionary on the island is quoted as saying that his powers defied \" analytical examination \" and that mathews really could say \" l \\'état est moi \" ( i am the state ) . mathews was also known as the \" strong man of zanzibar \" . the principal departments of government were mostly run by britons or british indians and mathews \\' approval was required before they could be removed from office . mathews was rewarded by the zanzibar government for his role with his appointment as a first class member of the order of the brilliant star of zanzibar , which he was granted licence by queen victoria to accept and wear on 17 may 1886 . mathews used his position to suppress slavery in the country and in 1889 convinced the sultan to issue a decree purchasing the freedom of all slaves who had taken refuge in his dominions and , from 1890 , the prohibiting the slave trade . on 1 february 1891 mathews was appointed her majesty \\'s commissioner and consul @-@ general to the british sphere of influence in east africa . he never took up the post and instead chose to remain in zanzibar . \\n  mathews was rewarded for his service in zanzibar by the british government which appointed him a companion of the order of st michael and st george in 1880 and a companion of the order of the bath on 24 may 1889 . despite becoming renowned in east africa as a man who ran a fair administration and was strict with criminals , unhappiness with effective british rule and his halting of the slave trade led some arabs to petition the sultan for his removal in 1892 . in 1893 mathews purchased the island of changuu for the government . he intended it to be used as a prison but it never housed prisoners and was instead used to quarantine yellow fever cases before its present use as a conservation area for giant tortoises . mathews was appointed a knight commander of the order of st michael and st george in 1894 . he was also awarded membership of the order of the crown by the german government . \\n  matters came to a head when khalid bin barghash attempted to take control of the palace in zanzibar town upon the death of his uncle in august 1896 , despite failing to gain the consent of the british consul there . mathews opposed this succession and , with british agreement , called up 900 soldiers in an attempt to prevent it . this situation eventually led to the anglo @-@ zanzibar war and mathews , with the support of admiral harry rawson and five vessels of the royal navy , bombarded the palace and secured the end of khalid \\'s administration . mathews \\' helped to arrange the succession of a pro @-@ british sultan , hamoud bin mohammed , as khalid \\'s successor . mathews continued his reforms after the war , abolishing slavery in 1897 and establishing new farms to grow produce using western techniques . he was appointed a member of the grand order of hamondieh of zanzibar and was permitted to accept and wear the decoration on 25 august 1897 . \\n  = = military expeditions = = \\n  = = =

first at mwele . the initial rebellion in the area had been led by mbaruk bin rashid at gazi , which mathews had put down with 1 @,@ 200 men in 1882 . however , in 1895 mbaruk \\'s nephew , mbaruk bin rashid , refused to acknowledge the appointment of a new leader at takaungu . this led to open rebellion at konjoro in february of that year when the younger mbaruk attacked zanzibari troops under arthur raikes , one of mathews \\' officers . mathews was part of an anglo @-@ zanzibari expedition sent to quell it , which consisted of 310 british sailors , 50 royal marines , 54 sudanese and 164 zanzibari troops . konjoro was destroyed and the leaders fled to gazi where the older mbaruk failed to turn them over . another force , under admiral rawson , with 400 british marines and sailors , was sent after them . this further expedition failed to capture the ringleaders and a third expedition was organised by rawson with 220 sailors , 80 marines , 60 sudanese and 50 zanzibaris , which destroyed mwele . during the latter action mathews was wounded in the shoulder . \\n  = = = witu = = = \\n  following the death of a german logger who had been operating illegally , the sultan of zanzibar and the british government dispatched an expedition on 20 october 1890 to bring the sultan of witu to justice . nine warships and three transports carrying 800 sailors and marines , 150 imperial british east africa company ( ibea ) indian police , 200 zanzibari and 50 sudanese troops were sent , defeating the sultan and establishing a british protectorate . the ibea was given control of the area and established a force of 250 indian police to maintain the peace . the police were withdrawn in july 1893 following threats of violence from the new sultan of witu , oman , and another expedition was dispatched to the region . this consisted of three warships : hms blanche , hms sparrow and the zanzibari ship hhs barawa . the latter carried mathews with 125 askaris and 50 sudanese under brigadier @-@ general hatch of the zanzibar army . \\n  mathews and an escort force went to witu where , on 31 july , they removed the flag of the ibea company and replaced it with the red flag of zanzibar , before destroying several villages and causing oman to retreat into the forests . the british troops then withdrew , having suffered heavily from malaria , but the sudanese and zanzibari troops remained . a further expedition was sent of 140 sailors and 85 other troops but oman died soon after and a more pliable sultan , omar bin hamid , was appointed to govern on behalf of zanzibar , bringing the affair to a close . in return for this action , mathews received the british east and west africa campaign medal . \\n  = = later life = = \\n  mathews died of malaria in zanzibar on 11 october 1901 and was buried with full military honours in the british cemetery outside zanzibar town . his successor as first minister was a.s. rogers . changuu island , which mathews bought for a

escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases . members of the herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses , as well as being caught for their meat , hair and hides . the herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges , and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979 . the kaimanawa herd was protected by the new zealand government in 1981 , and there were 1 @,@ 576 horses in the herd by 1994 . a small , mostly unmanaged population also exists on the aupouri peninsula at the northern tip of the north island . roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of the herd , removing around 2 @,@ 800 horses altogether . the kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the united nations \\' food and agricultural organization , and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed . \\n  = = history = = \\n  the first horses were introduced to new zealand by protestant missionary reverend samuel marsden in december 1814 , and wild horses were first reported in the kaimanawa range in central north island of new zealand in 1876 . the kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released in the late 19th century and early 20th century in the middle of the north island around the kaimanawa mountains . between 1858 and 1875 , major george gwavas carlyon imported exmoor ponies to hawkes bay and crossed them with local stock to produce the carlyon pony . these carlyon ponies were later crossed with two welsh stallions , kinarth caesar and comet , imported by sir donald mclean , and a breed known as the comet resulted . at some point during the 1870s , mclean released a comet stallion and several mares on the kaingaroa plains and the bloodline apparently became part of the wild kaimanawa population . other horses were added to the bloodline through escapes and releases from local sheep stations and from cavalry units at waiouru that were threatened with a strangles epidemic . it is also thought that in the 1960s nicholas koreneff released an arabian stallion into the argo valley region . \\n  throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , horses were harvested from the feral herds and used as riding and stock horses , as well as being used for their meat , hair and hides . originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the british crown and the native māori , but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses . kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the thoroughbred and other thoroughbred cross breeds . \\n  pressure from land development and an encroaching human population reduced the range and the number of the kaimanawa horses , and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained . starting in 1981 , the kaimanawa population , range size , and herd movements began to be officially measured , and a protected area was formed for the breed in the waiouru military training area . legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species . there was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed , and 1 @,@ 576 horses were known to exist in the area by 1994 . there is also a small population of horses on the aupouri peninsula at the northern tip of the north island , which is mostly unmanaged by the new zealand government . in 2008 , the kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called kaimanawa princess , by dianne haworth . \\n  = = breed characteristics = = \\n  many characteristics of the comet type are said to be shown in the kaimanawa horses today , although the varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes , colours , and body types among the wild horses . the kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance , with heights ranging between 12 @.@ 2 and 15 hands ( 50 and 60 inches , 127 and 152 cm ) high . any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable . they are usually well @-@ muscled . their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little , and they are usually sure @-@ footed and tough . they have a medium @-@ sized head in good proportion to their body , with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors . kaimanawa horses have a short , deep neck with a thick throat area , straight shoulders , a deep girth , and a short to medium back . the hindquarters vary from sloping to well @-@ rounded . the legs are long and well @-@ muscled , with strong hooves , and hind hooves that are generally smaller than the front ones . all horses are considered to age a year on the first of august , regardless of their actual foaling date . \\n  = = population control and study = = \\n  due to the increase in population after protective legislation was put into place , the department of conservation developed a management plan for the kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990 . a draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991 , and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters , and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd . however , core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option . trial musters were conducted in 1993 , 1994 and 1995 , and were successful , although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses . \\n  in 1994 , a working party was established to look at the management of the kaimanawa herd . they aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management , to ensure that the treatment of horses is humane , to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds , and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities . goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses , protecting natural ecosystems and features that the kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping the herd at a sustainable level . ecological objectives included ensuring that kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered , rare and biogeographically significant plants ; ensuring that the herd does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives ; and preventing the herd from spreading into the kaimanawa forest park and the tongariro national park . herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses , while still allowing and improving public access to the herd and ensuring humane treatment of the horses ; reducing conflict between the herd and other ecological values and land uses ; and ensuring that the herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging . \\n  the department of conservation has since 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of kaimanawas to keep the herd population around a target level of 500 horses . the target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009 . these horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes . a main reason for the strict population control is to protect the habitat in which they live . this habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered , which the kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing . these plants include herbs , grasses , sedges , flowers and mistletoes ; among these are deschampsia caespitosa ( a very rare tussock grass ) , peraxilla tetrapetala ( a vulnerable mistletoe ) and libertia peregrinans ( a possibly locally extinct sand iris ) . the 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd , the largest culling since the beginning of the program , with homes found for 85 % of the horses removed . conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public , and between 1990 and 2003 the new zealand minister for conservation received more public comments on the kaimanawa horse than on any other subject . in this period , more than 1 @,@ 400 requests for information and letters were received , with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997 . this was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996 ; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997 . in 1997 , around 1 @,@ 069 horses were removed from the range and adopted , reducing the main herd to around 500 , and reducing their range to around 25 @,@ 000 ha from around 70 @,@ 000 . since 1993 , a total of around 2 @,@ 800 horses have been removed from the range . only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred . \\n  the united nations \\' food and agricultural organization lists the kaimanawa horses as a herd of special genetic value that can be compared with other groups of feral horses such as new forest ponies , assateague ponies , wild mustangs , and with free @-@ living zebras . kaimanawas are of special value because of their low rate of interaction with humans . this lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics , which is of special interest to researchers . between 1994 and 1997 , students from massey university studied a population of around 400 kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics . a 2000 study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in kaimanawa horse herds , only the two stallions highest in the herd hierarchy mate with the herd females . this differs from other feral horse herds , some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares , while others have several stallions that sire foals . \\n  = the remix ( lady gaga album ) = \\n  the remix is a remix album by american recording artist lady gaga . released in japan on march 3 , 2010 , it contains remixes of the songs from her first

in japan on march 3 , 2010 , containing sixteen of the remixes . the revised version , consisting of seventeen remixes , was released on may 3 , 2010 , the first market being mexico . manson features on the chew fu remix of \" lovegame \" , while passion pit remixed \" telephone \" and pet shop boys remixed \" eh , eh ( nothing else i can say ) \" . other artists who remixed gaga \\'s songs included alphabeat , frankmusik , stuart price , monarchy and robots to mars . the album was released in the united kingdom on may 10 , 2010 and featured a different artwork for that region . the us

into an electronic version , changing the original mid @-@ tempo composition of the song . new vocals were added on top of the song , giving it a jungle @-@ like vibe , according to nicki escuerdo from phoenix new times . she also felt that the remix of \" lovegame \" featuring manson , changed the original composition by \" giving the originally innocent and fun song an almost demonic quality \" . according to campbell , the monarchy stylites remix of \" dance in the dark \" \" pump [ ed ] extra oomph \" into the song , with addition of drum beats . richard vission \\'s remix of \" just dance \" introduced an elastic rhythm in the song , while frankmusik changed the soft composition of \" eh , eh ( nothing else i can say ) \" to a more upbeat one , also manipulating gaga \\'s vocals in the process . campbell also added that the passion pit remix of \" telephone \" felt like a \" theatrical set up for a song that feels like it \\'s going somewhere , but never does \" ; the remix consists of synths , with a thumping beat accompanying the song . sound of arrows remixed \" alejandro \" , changing the dark nature of its music into a bright , summery jam while \" bad romance \" was remixed by starsmith , making it a complete dance track . \\n  = = critical reception = = \\n  upon its release , the album met with mixed reviews . at metacritic it holds an aggregate score of 54 out of 100 points , indicating generally mixed or average reviews . simon cage from the daily express gave the album three out of five stars and felt that although she \" has a winning way with ostentatious hats \" , gaga \\'s true talent lies in selling the same album over and over again . \" it ’ s great but ... enough already ! \" music critic j. d. considine , while reviewing the album for the globe and mail , complimented the piano and voice version of \" poker face \" adding that the latter was \" the smartest track on her newest remix album \" . he felt that the song \" brings out her inner elton john . and yes , this move , too , is probably just another bit of calculated image management , but that doesn ’ t make it any less brilliant . \" robert copsey from digital spy noted that the release of the remix was a more natural progression than music labels trying to \" cash @-@ in \" by releasing something not associated with the artist . he complimented the remixers featured in the album , calling them \" as vital to keeping the singer \\'s music fresh as her haus of gaga designers are to her image . \" \\n  stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic gave the album three out of five stars , but felt that the track list could have been shortened . erlewine complimented some of the remixes , including those by pet shop boys and space cowboy , adding that the remix \" is not an essential addition to gaga ’ s canon goes without saying ... but there ’ s glitz and glamour to enjoy here . \" mark beech , reviewing the album for bloomberg television , noticed that the already familiar tracks from gaga \" are given a new sheen by the pet shop boys and sometime madonna producer stuart price . \" nicki escudero from phoenix new times gave a positive review saying that the songs featured in the remix can be a great addition during workouts , as well as staple dance floor music . she listed the chew fu remix of \" lovegame \" as a highlight from the album . monica herrera from billboard complimented the album saying \" gaga has employed a collection of more @-@ than @-@ capable producers to make her dance @-@ ready smashes from the fame and the fame

release history = = \\n  = architecture of the song dynasty = \\n  the architecture of the song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) was noted for its towering buddhist pagodas , enormous stone and wooden bridges , lavish tombs , and extravagant palaces . although literary works on architecture existed beforehand , architectural writing blossomed during the song dynasty , maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise , organized manner . in addition to the examples still standing , depictions in song artwork , architectural drawings , and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the architecture of the period . \\n  the professions of architect , master craftsman , carpenter , and structural engineer did not have the high status of the confucian scholar @-@ officials during the dynastic era . architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years , usually from craftsman fathers to their sons . there were also government agencies and schools for construction , building , and engineering . the song dynasty \\'s building manuals aided not only the various private workshops , but also the craftsmen employed by the central government . \\n  = = city and palace = = \\n  the layout of ancient chinese capitals , such as bianjing , capital of the northern song , followed the guidelines in kao gong ji , which specified a square city wall with several gates on each side and passageways for the emperor . the outer city of ancient bianjing was built during the reign of emperor shenzong to a rectangular plan , almost square in proportions , about 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from north to south and 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) from west to east . the south wall had three gates , with nanxun gate in the center , chenzhou gate to the east , and dailou gate to the west . the other walls had four gates each : in the east wall were dongshui gate ( at the southern end ) , xinsong gate , xinchao gate , and north @-@ east water gate ; in the west wall xinzheng gate , west water gate , wansheng gate , and guzi gate ; and in the north wall chenqiao gate ( at the eastern end ) , fengqiu gate , new wild jujube gate and weizhou gate . the gates in the center of each of the four sides were reserved for the emperor ; these gates had straight passages and only two sets of doors , while the other city gates had zigzag passages and were guarded by three sets of doors . \\n  the song artist zhang zeduan \\'s painting along the river during the qingming festival depicts the dongshui gate in detail : the building on top had a five @-@ ridged roof with a shallow slope in the song dynasty style , supported prominently by two sets of brackets ( dougong ) . the lower bracket assembly rested on the city gate to form a wooden foundation , while the upper assembly supported the roof , similar to the dougong in an extant song building , the goddess temple in taiyuan . this method of using bracket assemblies to support superstructure was specified in li jie \\'s 12th @-@ century building manual yingzao fashi as pingzuo ( literally \" flat base \" ) . \\n  the city wall itself was built with rammed earth , a technique also detailed in yingzao fashi , vol . iii , \" standards for moat , stronghold and masonry work \" : \\n  foundation : for every square chi , apply two dan of earth ; on top of it lay a mixture of broken brick , tile and crushed stones , also two dan . for every five @-@ cun layer of earth , two men , standing face to face , should tamp six times with pestles , each man pounding three times on a dent ; then tamp four times on each dent , two men again standing face to face , each pounding twice on the same dent ; then tamp two more times , each man pounding once . following this , tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface . every five @-@ cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun ; every three @-@ cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun . \\n  rammed @-@ earth walls during this time were tapered : the thickness of the wall is greatest at the base and decreases steadily with increasing height , as detailed in li jie \\'s book . \\n  during the song dynasty , the city of bianjing had three enclosures : the outer city wall , the inner city wall , and the palace at the center . the inner city was rectangular , with three doors on each side . the palace enclosure was also rectangular , with a watch tower on each of the four corners . it had four main gates : xihua gate to the west , donghua gate to the east , gongchen gate to the north , and xuande gate , also known as duan gate or xuandelou , at the south . xuande gate had five @-@ paneled doors , painted red and decorated with gold tacks ; its walls were lavishly decorated with dragon , phoenix and floating @-@ cloud patterns to match the carved beams , painted rafters and glazed @-@ tile roof . there were also two glazed dragons , each biting an end of the rooftop ridge , its tail pointing to the sky . the symbolic function of these chi wei was explained in yingzao fashi : \\n  there is a dragon in the east sea , whose tail ( wei ) is similar to that of a sparrow @-@ hawk ( chi ) ; it stirs up waves and causes rainfall , so people put its likeness on the rooftop to prevent fire . however , they misnamed it \" sparrow @-@ hawk tail \" ( chi wei ) . \\n  running southward from xuande gate was the imperial boulevard , about two hundred paces wide , with the imperial corridors on either side . merchants opened shops in the corridors until 1112 , when they were banned . two rows of black fencing were placed at the center of the boulevard as a barrier to pedestrians and carriages . along the inner sides of the fences ran the brick @-@ lined imperial water furrows , filled with lotus . about 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) south from xuande gate , the bian river intercepted the imperial boulevard , which crossed it over the stone zhou bridge , balustraded and flat @-@ decked . this design of a boulevard with a stone bridge crossing a river was later imitated in the forbidden city . during spring and summer , mingled peach , plum , pear and apricot trees adorned the banks of the bian with a variety of flowers . \\n  = = buddhist pagodas = = \\n  following the reign of the han dynasty , ( 202 bc – 220 ad ) , the idea of the buddhist stupa entered chinese culture , as a means to house and protect scriptural sutras . during the southern and northern dynasties period , the distinctive chinese pagoda was developed , its predecessors being the tall watch towers and towering residential apartments of the han dynasty ( as inferred from models in han @-@ era tombs ) . during the sui ( 581 – 618 ) and tang ( 618 – 907 ) periods , chinese pagodas were developed from purely wooden structures to use articulated stone and brick , which could more easily survive fires caused by lightning or arson and were less susceptible to decay . the earliest brick pagoda that remains extant is the songyue pagoda , built in 523 , and a typical example of a tang @-@ era stone pagoda is the giant wild goose pagoda , constructed in 652 . although buddhist influences on china waned after the late tang period , numerous buddhist pagoda towers were built during the song dynasty . tall chinese pagodas were often built in the countryside rather than within a city \\'s walls , largely to avoid competition with the cosmic @-@ imperial authority embodied in the cities \\' drum- and gate @-@ towers . the giant wild goose pagoda , built in a city ward of what was southeastern chang \\'an , is among the exceptions . \\n  the iron pagoda of youguo temple in kaifeng earned it name from the iron @-@ grey color of the glazed bricks forming the tower . originally built of wood by the architect yu hao , it was struck by lightning and burned down in 1044 , during the northern song period . in 1049 the pagoda was rebuilt as it appears today , under the order of emperor renzong of song . this 13 @-@ story pagoda , structured on an octagonal base , is 56 @.@ 88 meters ( 186 @.@ 6 ft ) tall . its glazed tile bricks feature carved artwork of dancing figures , solemn ministers , and buddhist themes ( see gallery below ) . \\n  the period also featured true cast @-@ iron pagodas , such as the iron pagoda of yuquan temple ( jade springs temple ) , dangyang , hubei province . built in 1061 , it incorporates 53 @,@ 848 kg ( 118 @,@ 715 lb ) of cast iron and stands 21 @.@ 28 m ( 69 @.@ 8 ft ) tall . imitating contemporary wooden , stone , and brick pagodas , the pagoda features sloping eaves and an octagonal base . another iron pagoda was constructed in 1105 , jining , shandong , and was cast layer by layer in octagonal sections , standing 78 feet high . several such cast iron pagodas exist in china today . \\n  the liuhe pagoda , or six harmonies pagoda , is another example of song @-@ era pagoda architecture . it is located in the southern song capital of hangzhou , in zhejiang province , at the foot of yuelun hill facing the qiantang river . although the original was destroyed in 1121 , the current tower was erected in 1156 and fully restored by 1165 . it stands 59 @.@ 89 m ( 196 @.@ 5 ft ) tall , and was constructed from a red brick frame with 13 stages of wooden eaves . because of its size , the pagoda served as a permanent lighthouse to aid sailors at night ( as described in hangzhou fu zhi ) . \\n  the zhengjue temple pagoda in pengxian county of sichuan province ( near chengdu ) is a brick pagoda that was built between 1023 and 1026 , according to inscriptions running along its first storey . it has a square base on a sumeru pedestal , thirteen stories totaling 28 m ( 92 ft ) in height , and multiple layers of eaves similar in style to the earlier tang pagodas of chang \\'an , the giant wild goose pagoda and the small wild goose pagoda . \\n  wood @-@ and @-@ brick hybrid pagodas were also built . the first four floors of the octagonal , 42 m ( 138 ft ) lingxiao pagoda of 1045 are brick ( with wooden eaves ) , while from the fifth floor up it is entirely made of wood . even pagodas made of stone or brick featured architectural elements that were typical of chinese wooden buildings ; for example the pizhi pagoda , built from 1056 to 1063 , uses the dougong brackets typical of wooden architecture to hold up pent , shingled roofs and tiers . both of these pagodas feature interior staircases , although the lingxiao pagoda \\'s only reaches to the fourth floor , and the pizhi pagoda \\'s to the fifth . however , the pizhi pagoda features winding exterior stairs that provide access to the ninth and topmost floor . \\n  although the pagoda of fogong temple is the tallest extant wooden pagoda , the tallest chinese pagoda built in the dynastic era that remains standing is the liaodi pagoda . completed in 1055 , it is 84 meters ( 276 ft ) tall , with an octagonal base on a large platform , surpassing the 69 @-@ meter ( 226 ft ) qianxun pagoda , which had held the record since its construction in the 9th century by the kingdom of dali . although the liaodi pagoda served its religious purpose as a buddhist landmark in the kaiyuan monastery of ding county , hebei province , its great height gave it another valuable function , as a military watch tower that was used to observe movements of the liao enemy . beside their utility in surveillance , pagoda towers could also serve as astronomical observatories ; one such is the gaocheng astronomical observatory , built in 1276 and still standing today . \\n  yunyan pagoda \\n  = = temples = = \\n  it was not uncommon for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes , usually by donating a portion of their family estate to a buddhist sect . often the land already contained buildings that could be re @-@ purposed for religions use . the fei ( 費 ) family of the town of jinze , located just west of shanghai , converted a mansion on their property into a buddhist sutra @-@ recitiation hall , and later built several other religious buildings around the hall . this spurred a boom in temple construction in the area , causing jinze to become a major center of the white lotus sect of buddhism , which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the song . the nearby town of nanxiang gained prominence shortly after the fall of the song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings , which spanned the entire song empire . \\n  apart from stimulating the development of urban areas , temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features . the temple of the saintly mother ( 圣母殿 ) and the hall of sacrifice of the jin temple ( 晋祠 ) , located in a southeastern suburb of taiyuan city , shanxi province , are extant examples of early song architecture . the temple of the saintly mother is the main building of the jin temple , first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102 . it has a double @-@ eaved roof with nine ridges , and two dragon @-@ heads with wide @-@ open jaws biting the ends of the main ridge . the roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in yingzao fashi . the eaves of the temple of the saintly mother curve upward slightly at each end , a characteristic of song architecture . the columns of the façade , decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts , become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair . the building has a porch around it , the sole example of such a structure ; another unique feature of the site is a cross @-@ shaped bridge that leads to the goddess temple . \\n  the trinity hall of xuan miao temple ( 玄妙观 ) , situated in the heart of suzhou city , is another example of song architecture . in 1982 , it was established as a national heritage site by the chinese government . \\n  the jingling palace ( 景灵宫 , jingling gong ) , a temple to the legendary yellow emperor located near modern @-@ day qufu , was built in the 11th century . it was subsequently destroyed near the end of the yuan dynasty . however , several other structures in shou qiu , the complex that jingling palace was situated in , remain intact . two giant tortoise @-@ borne steles flank what was the entrance to the palace . one of the two steles , the stele of the sorrow of 10 @,@ 000 , is at 52 meters ( 171 ft ) high , the tallest unmarked stele in the country . a large pyramid constructed of rounded stone blocks , the symbolic tomb of the yellow

bridges = = \\n  bridges over waterways had been known in china since the ancient zhou dynasty . during the song dynasty , large trestle bridges were constructed , such as that built by zhang zhongyan in 1158 . there were also large bridges made entirely of stone , like the ba zi bridge of shaoxing , built in 1256 and still standing today . bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of xia gui ( 1195 – 1224 ) . long , covered corridor bridges , like the 12th @-@ century rainbow bridge in wuyuan , jiangxi province , which has wide stone @-@ based piers and a wooden superstructure , were also built . \\n  while serving as an administrator for hangzhou , the poet su shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) had a large pedestrian causeway built across the west lake , which still bears his name : sudi ( 蘇堤 ) . in 1221 , the taoist traveler qiu changchun visited genghis khan in samarkand , describing various chinese bridges encountered on the way there through the tian shan mountains , east of yining . the historian joseph needham quotes him as saying : \\n  [ the road had ] \" no less than 48 timber bridges of such width that two carts can drive over them side by side \" . it had been built by chang jung [ zhang rong ] and the other engineers of the chagatai some years before . the wooden trestles of chinese bridges from the − 3rd century [ bc ] onwards were no doubt similar to those supposed to have been employed in julius caesar \\'s bridge of − 55 [ bc ] across the rhine , or drawn by leonardo , or found in use in africa . but where in + 13th century [ ad ] europe could a two @-@ lane highway like chang jung \\'s have been found ? \\n  in fujian province , enormous beam bridges were built during the song dynasty . some of these were as long as 1 @,@ 220 m ( 4 @,@ 000 ft ) , with individual spans of up to 22 m ( 72 ft ) in length ; their construction necessitated moving massive stones of 203 t ( 203 @,@ 000 kg ) . no names of the engineers were recorded or appear in the inscriptions on the bridges , which give only the names of local officials who sponsored them and oversaw their construction and repair . however , there might have been an engineering school in fujian , headed by a prominent engineer known as cai xiang ( 1012 – 1067 ) , who had risen to the position of governmental prefect in fujian . between 1053 and 1059 , he planned and supervised the construction of the large wanan bridge ( once called the luoyang bridge ) near quanzhou ( on the border of the present @-@ day luojiang district and huai \\'an county . this bridge , a stone structure similar to a number of other bridges found in fujian , still stands , and features ship @-@ like piers bound to their bases using mucilage from oysters as an adhesive . it is 731 m ( 2 @,@ 398 ft ) in length , 5 m ( 16 ft ) in width , and 7 m ( 23 ft ) in height . another famous bridge near quanzhou , the anping bridge , was constructed between 1138 and 1151 . \\n  other examples of song bridges include guyue bridge , a stone arch bridge in yiwu , zhejiang province . the bridge was built in 1213 , the sixth year of the jiading era in the southern song dynasty . song @-@ era pontoon bridges include the dongjin bridge , 400 m ( 1 ⁄ 4 mi ) long , which may still be seen today . \\n  = = tombs of the northern song emperors = = \\n  located southwest of gongyi city in gongxian county , henan province , the large tombs of the northern song number about one thousand , including individual tombs for song emperors , empresses , princes , princesses , consorts , and members of the extended family . the complex extends approximately 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) from east to west and 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) from north to south . the construction of the complex began in 963 ad , during the reign of the first song ruler , emperor taizu of song , whose father is also buried at the site . the only northern song emperors not buried there are emperor huizong of song and emperor qinzong of song , who died in captivity after the jurchen invasion of northern china in 1127 . lining the spirit ways of the tomb complex are hundreds of song sculptures and statues of tigers , rams , lions , horses with grooms , horned beasts and mythical creatures , government officials , military generals , foreign ambassadors , and others featured in an enormous display of song @-@ era artwork . \\n  the layout and style of the song tombs resemble those found in the contemporary tangut kingdom of the western xia , which also had an auxiliary burial site associated with each tomb . at the center of each burial site is a truncated pyramidal tomb , each having once been guarded by a four @-@ walled enclosure with four centered gates and four corner towers . about 100 km ( 62 mi ) from gongxian is the baisha tomb , which contains \" elaborate facsimiles in brick of chinese timber frame construction , from door lintels to pillars and pedestals to bracket sets , that adorn interior walls . \" the baisha tomb has two large separate chambers with conical ceilings ; a large staircase leads down to the entrance doors of the subterranean tomb . \\n  = = literature = = \\n  during the song dynasty , previous works on architecture were brought to more sophisticated levels of description , as in yili shigong , written by li ruogui in 1193 ad . one of the most definitive works , however , was the earlier mu jing ( \" timberwork manual \" ) , ascribed to yu hao and written sometime between 965 and 995 . yu hao was responsible for the construction of a wooden pagoda tower in kaifeng , which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick iron pagoda soon after . in his time , books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft \\'s status , so mu jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography . although the book itself was lost to history , the scientist and statesman shen kuo wrote of yu \\'s work extensively in his dream pool essays of 1088 , praising it as a work of architectural genius , saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work . shen kuo singled out , among other passages , a scene in which yu hao gives advice to another artisan @-@ architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind , and a passage in which yu hao describes the three sections of a building , the area above the crossbeams , the area above ground , and the foundation , and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section . \\n  several years later li jie ( 李誡 ; 1065 – 1110 ) published yingzao fashi ( \" treatise on architectural methods \" or \" state building standards \" ) . although similar books came before it , such as yingshan ling ( \" national building law \" ) of the early tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) , li \\'s book is the earliest technical manual on chinese architecture to have survived in full . \\n  = = = yingzao fashi = = = \\n  yingzao fashi is a technical treatise on architecture and craftsmanship written by li jie , an architect and official at the directorate of buildings and

published three years later , in 1103 , for the benefit of foremen , architects , and literate craftsmen . the book was intended to provide standard regulations , to not only the engineering agencies of the central government , but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout china who could benefit from using a well @-@ written government manual on building practices . \\n  yingzao fashi included building codes and regulations , accounting information , descriptions of construction materials , and classification of crafts . in its 34 chapters , the book outlined units of measurement , and the construction of moats , fortifications , stonework , and woodwork . for the latter , it included specifications for making bracketing units with inclined arms and joints for columns and beams . it also provided specifications for wood carving , drilling , sawing , bamboo work , tiling , wall building , and decoration . the book contained recipes for decorative paints , glazes , and coatings , also listing proportions for mixing mortars used in masonry , . brickwork , and manufacture of glazed tiles , illustrating practices and standards with drawings . his book outlined structural carpentry in great detail , providing standard dimensional measurements for all components used ; . here he developed a standard eight @-@ grade system for sizing timber elements , known as the cai @-@ fen system of units , which could be universally applied in buildings . about 8 % of li jie \\'s book was derived from pre @-@ existing written material on architecture , while the majority of the book documented the inherited traditions of craftsmen and architects . the yingzao fashi provided a full glossary of technical terms that included mathematical formulae , building proportions , and construction techniques , and discussed the implications of the local topography for construction at a particular site . he also estimated the monetary costs of hiring laborers of different skill levels from various crafts on the basis of a day \\'s work , in addition to the price of the materials they would need and according to the season in which they were to be employed .

4 mission . franglen and deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called flight to the moon ( 1969 ) ; the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were . deakin later said , \" \\' one small step \\' leaves me cold , because it was so obviously scripted . but the spacewalk … even after hearing it so many times , it \\'s so vivid . \" \\n  \" ramblin \\' man

he lists various places from around the world , ranging from \" from small sussex villages to major world capitals . \" when listed in the order in which the locations are narrated , the message \" bagpuss sees all things \" is spelled out midway through the song ( from brixton at four minutes ten seconds , to san josé at four minutes 31 seconds ) using the first letter of each location . the fourth track , \" return to patagonia \" , features several jazz @-@ inspired elements . \\n  the song \" nice weather for ducks \" is built around a sample inspired by john langstaff \\'s song \" all the ducks \" . this song was based on the popular dutch children \\'s song , \" alle eendjes zwemmen in het water \" ( translated : \" all the ducks are swimming in the water \" ) . franglen later said that he and deakin were drawn to langstaff \\'s recording because it \" had a gentle madness to it , slightly unhinged \" . the duo had attempted to clear langstaff \\'s version for sampling , but were unable to . in the end , they had enn reitel re @-@ record the vocal snippet . franglen , while noting that reitel \\'s performance was good , said that once the sample was re @-@ recorded , its \" edge disappeared \" . \" experimental number 6 \" , arguably the album \\'s darkest track , features a faux field recording of a doctor documenting the side effects of an unnamed drug

reconstruction antwerp ) group of researchers of the ibbt ( interdisciplinary institute for broadband technology ) visionlab at the university of antwerp and by belgian computer shop tones , in collaboration with asus , a taiwanese multinational computer product manufacturer , as the successor to the fastra i ( built in 2008 ) . \\n  the fastra ii was determined to be over three times faster than the fastra i , which in turn was slightly faster than a 512 @-@ core cluster . however , because of the number of gpus in the computer , the system initially suffered from several issues , like the system refusing to reboot and overheating due to a lack of space between the video cards . \\n  = = development = = \\n  the computer was built as a researching and demonstration project by the astra group of researchers at the vision lab in the university of antwerp in belgium , one of the researchers being joost batenburg . unlike other modern supercomputers such as the cray jaguar and the ibm roadrunner , which cost millions of euros , the fastra ii only uses consumer hardware , costing € 6 @,@ 000 in total . \\n  the fastra ii \\'s predecessor , the fastra i , has 4 dual @-@ gpu geforce 9800 gx2 video cards , for a total of 8 gpus . at that time , the astra group needed a motherboard that had four pci express x16 slots with double @-@ spacing between each of them . the only such motherboard the astra group could find at that time was the msi k9a2 platinum , which has four such slots . in 2009 , the asus p6t7 ws supercomputer motherboard , which the fastra ii uses , was released , which has seven pci express x16 slots . the fastra ii has six faster dual @-@ gpu geforce gtx 295 video cards , and a single @-@ gpu geforce gtx 275 , for a total of 13 gpus . in the fastra ii , the gpus mainly perform tomographic reconstruction . the technique which allows gpus to perform general @-@ purpose tasks like this outside of gaming , instead of cpus , is called gpgpu , general @-@ purpose computing on graphics processing units . \\n  overheating caused by the lack of space between the video cards forces researchers using the fastra ii to keep the side panel door open , so that the video cards can get regular air , decreasing the overall temperature inside the case . \\n  due to the number of gpus in the system , its initial boot was unsuccessful . this was because its motherboard uses a 32 bit bios , which only had approximately 3 gb of address space for the video cards . however , asus managed to provide them a specialized bios that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the gtx 295 video cards . the bios @-@ replacement coreboot was not tested . \\n  all seven pci express x16 slots in the asus p6t7 motherboard were used in the building of the fastra ii computer . however , the video cards in the fastra ii are wide enough to require two such slots each . to solve this issue , the researchers came up with flexible pci express cables , and tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard . \\n  = = specifications and benchmarks = = \\n  like the fastra i , the fastra ii uses a lian li pc @-@ p80 armorsuit case , which has 10 expansion slots . the motherboard in the fastra ii was at that time the only workstation motherboard that had seven full @-@ sized pci express x16 slots . the memory modules were initially six 2 gb modules , but were later upgraded to 4 gb each , for a total of 24 gb . instead of an eighth dual @-@ gpu video card , the single @-@ gpu gtx 275 is in the computer because , out of all the video cards in the fastra ii , the gtx 275 is the only one the fastra ii \\'s bios can fully initialize . the total amount of gpus is 13 . the video cards together bring 12 teraflops of computing power . four of the six gtx 295 video cards have 2 pcbs , while the other two have only 1 pcb . \\n  according to the benchmarks on its official website , the fastra ii is faster and more power efficient than its competitors , including the fastra i and the tesla c1060 video card . the benchmarks were performed on the fastra ii , the fastra i , a 512 @-@ core cluster ( consisting of opteron cpus ) , an nvidia tesla c1060 workstation card on an intel core i7 940 cpu , and on an intel core i7 940 cpu itself . the fastra ii is over three times faster than the fastra i in ct slice reconstruction speed . although the fastra ii consumes more power than the fastra i , it \\'s nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the fastra i , and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512 @-@ core cluster . the video cards run at 37 degrees celsius when idle , and at 60 degrees celsius at full load . \\n  = = applications and reception = = \\n  the operating system is centos , a community driven linux distribution and red hat enterprise linux clone . the fastra ii received a positive public impression . techie.com called it the \" world \\'s most powerful desktop @-@ sized

\\'s scalable link interface ( sli ) and is therefore limited to the number of gpus supported by it and also by the vendor respectively the free and open @-@ source device drivers . the fastra ii \\'s

keathley canyon block 102 of the united states sector of the gulf of mexico . the deepwater field ( defined as water depth 1 @,@ 300 to 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 400 to 1 @,@ 520 m ) , ) was discovered in september 2009 and it is operated by bp . described as a \" giant \" find , it is estimated to contain 4 to 6 billion barrels ( 640 × 10 ^ 6 to 950 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of oil in place . although bp states it is too early to be sure of the size – a \" huge \" field is usually considered to contain 250 million barrels ( 40 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) . it required the drilling of a 10 @,@ 685 m ( 35 @,@ 056 ft ) deep well under 1 @,@ 260 m ( 4 @,@ 130 ft ) of water , making it one of the deepest wells ever drilled at the time of discovery . \\n  = = description = = \\n  tiber comprises multiple lower tertiary petroleum reservoirs located in keathley canyon block 102 about 250 mi ( 400 km ) southeast of houston and 300 mi ( 480 km ) south west of new orleans . tiber is only the 18th lower tertiary well to date , and drilling in these formations is in its infancy . the oil from tiber is light crude , and early estimates of recoverable reserves are around 20 – 30 % recovery , suggesting figures of around 600 to 900 million barrels ( 95 × 10 ^ 6 to 143 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of reserves . sources such as bloomberg suggest caution , warning that the find is technically complex and potentially could take 5 – 6 years to produce oil or be lower yield ( 5 – 15 % ) based on \" rates talked about \" at nearby kaskida oil field , bp \\'s previous giant find ( 2006 ) 40 mi ( 64 km ) away . the commercial prospects of the field have not yet been evaluated . \\n  = = discovery = = \\n  bp acquired the outer continental shelf lease of keathley canyon block 102 reference g25782 , noaa station 42872 , on october 22 , 2003 , in phase 2 of the western gulf of mexico ( wgom / gom ) sale 187 . lower tertiary rock formations are some of the oldest and most technically challenging offshore rock formations currently drilled for oil , dating to between 23 and 66 million years ago . the plan of exploration was filed in june 2008 . \\n  tiber was initially drilled by transocean \\'s fifth @-@ generation dynamic positioned semi @-@ submersible oil rig , deepwater horizon , with exploratory drilling commencing around march 2009 , slightly delayed from the planned date of september 2008 . much of the deeper gulf reserves are buried under salt accumulations thousands of feet thick , which present a problem for seismic exploration . bp had previously developed exploration techniques to bypass this difficulty . oil was located at \" multiple levels \" . the field was announced on september 2 , 2009 , and bp shares rose 3 @.@ 7 percent on the news . with tiber joining at least ten other successful lower tertiary explorations in the area , analysts viewed the announcement as a sign for optimism , and a harbinger of renewed interest in , and production from , the offshore gulf of mexico . \\n  = = exploration on hold = = \\n  following the april 2010 destruction of the deepwater horizon while drilling the macondo well , and the resulting oil spill , all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the gulf of mexico , including tiber , were placed on hold . at least two rigs that might otherwise have been used for developing tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well . \\n  = glorious first of june = \\n  the glorious first of june ( also known in france as the bataille du 13 prairial an 2 or combat de prairial ) [ note a ] of 1794 was the first and largest fleet action of the naval conflict between the kingdom of great britain and the first french republic during the french revolutionary wars . \\n  the action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss @-@ crossed the bay of biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial , but inconclusive , fleet actions . the british channel fleet under admiral lord howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital french grain convoy from the united states , which was protected by the french atlantic fleet , commanded by rear @-@ admiral villaret @-@ joyeuse . the two forces clashed in the atlantic ocean , some 400 nautical miles ( 700 km ) west of the french island of ushant on 1 june 1794 . \\n  during the battle , howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the french and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent . this unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains , and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended . nevertheless , his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the french fleet . in the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered ; in no condition for further combat , howe and villaret returned to their home ports . despite losing seven of his ships of the line , villaret had bought enough time for the french grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by howe \\'s fleet , securing a strategic success . however , he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port , leaving the british free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war . in the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies . \\n  the glorious first of june demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the french and british navies at the start of the revolutionary wars . both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains , along with ill @-@ discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews , and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat . \\n  = = background = = \\n  since early 1792 france had been at war with four of its neighbours on two fronts , battling austria and prussia in the austrian netherlands , and the austrians and piedmontese in italy . on 2 january 1793 , almost one year into the french revolutionary war , republican @-@ held forts at brest in brittany fired on the british brig hms childers . [ note b ] a few weeks later , following the execution of the imprisoned king louis xvi , diplomatic ties between britain and france were broken . on 1 february france declared war on both britain and the dutch republic . \\n  protected from immediate invasion by the english channel , britain prepared for an extensive naval campaign and dispatched troops to the netherlands for service against the french . throughout the remainder of 1793 , the british and french navies undertook minor operations in northern waters , the mediterranean and the west and east indies , where both nations maintained colonies . the closest the channel fleet had come to an engagement was when it had narrowly missed intercepting the french convoy from the caribbean , escorted by 15 ships of the line on 2 august . the only major clash was the siege of toulon , a confused and bloody affair in which the british force holding the town — alongside spanish , sardinian , austrian and french royalist troops — had to be evacuated by the royal navy to prevent its imminent defeat at the hands of the french republican army . the aftermath of this siege was punctuated by recriminations and accusations of cowardice and betrayal among the allies , eventually resulting in spain switching allegiance with the signing of the treaty of san ildefonso two years later . nevertheless , the siege produced one major success : sir sidney smith , with parties of sailors from the retreating british fleet , accomplished the destruction of substantial french naval stores and shipping in toulon . more might have been achieved had the spanish raiding parties that accompanied smith not been issued with secret orders to stall the destruction of the french fleet . \\n  the situation in europe remained volatile into 1794 . off northern france , the french atlantic fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay . in consequence , the french navy officer corps suffered greatly from the effects of the reign of terror , with many experienced sailors being executed , imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty . the shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though ; france itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest . by this time at war with all her neighbours , france had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions . eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the national convention : food produced in france \\'s overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in chesapeake bay , and augmented with food and goods purchased from the united states . during april and may 1794 , the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the atlantic to brest , protected by elements of the french atlantic fleet . \\n  = = fleets = = \\n  the navies of britain and france in 1794 were at very different stages of development . although the british fleet was numerically superior , the french ships were larger and stronger , and carried a heavier weight of shot . the largest french ships were three @-@ decker first rates , carrying 110 or 120 guns , against 100 guns on the largest british vessels . \\n  = = = royal navy = = = \\n  since the spanish armament of 1790 , the royal navy had been at sea in a state of readiness for over three years . the navy \\'s dockyards under first lord of the admiralty charles middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict . this was quite unlike the disasters of the american revolutionary war ten years earlier , when an ill @-@ prepared royal navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the north american campaign — which ended in defeat at the battle of yorktown due to lack of supplies . with british dockyards now readily turning out cannon , shot , sails , provisions and other essential equipment , the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the navy list . \\n  unfortunately for the british , gathering sufficient manpower was difficult and never satisfactorily accomplished throughout the entire war . the shortage of seamen was such that press gangs were forced to take thousands of men with no experience on the sea , meaning that training and preparing them for naval life would take quite some time . the lack of royal marines was even more urgent , and soldiers from the british army were drafted into the fleet for service at sea . men of the 2nd . regiment of foot - the queen \\'s ( royal west surrey regiment ) and the 29th regiment of foot served aboard royal navy ships during the campaign ; their descendant regiments still maintain the battle honour \" 1 june 1794 \" . \\n  despite these difficulties , the channel fleet was possessed of one of the best naval commanders of the age ; its commander @-@ in @-@ chief , richard howe , 1st earl howe , had learned his trade under sir edward hawke and fought at the battle of quiberon bay in 1759 . in the spring of 1794 , with the french convoy \\'s arrival in european waters imminent , howe had dispersed his fleet in three groups . george montagu , in hms hector , was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard british convoys to the east indies , west indies and newfoundland as far as cape finisterre . peter rainier , in hms suffolk and commanding six other ships , was to escort the convoys for the rest of their passage . the third force consisted of 26 ships of the line , with several supporting vessels , under howe \\'s direct command . they were to patrol the bay of biscay for the arriving french . \\n  = = = french navy = = = \\n  in contrast to their british counterparts , the french navy was in a state of confusion . although the quality of the fleet \\'s ships was high , the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through france since the revolution five years earlier . consequently , the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews , which were largely untrained and inexperienced . with the terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior french sailors and officers , political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all , let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the atlantic fleet . \\n  the manpower problem was compounded by the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation , with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times . in august 1793 , these problems came to a head in the fleet off brest , when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors . the crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food , leaving the french coast undefended . the national convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship \\'s non @-@ commissioned officers . hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned , banished or dismissed from naval service . the effect of this purge was devastating , seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel . in their places were promoted junior officers , merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal , although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea . \\n  the newly appointed commander of this troubled fleet was villaret de joyeuse ; although formerly in a junior position , he was known to possess a high degree of tactical ability ; he had trained under admiral pierre andré de suffren in the indian ocean during the american war . however , villaret \\'s attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee , a deputy of the national convention named jean @-@ bon saint @-@ andré . saint @-@ andré \\'s job was to report directly to the national convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral . he frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations . shortly after his arrival , saint @-@ andré proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should be put to death on his return to france , although this highly controversial legislation does not appear to have ever been acted upon . although his interference was a source of frustration for villaret , saint @-@ andré \\'s dispatches to paris were published regularly in le moniteur , and did much to popularise the navy in france . \\n  the french atlantic fleet was even more dispersed than the british in the spring of 1794 : rear @-@ admiral pierre vanstabel had been dispatched , with five ships including two of the line , to meet the much @-@ needed french grain convoy off the american eastern seaboard . rear @-@ admiral joseph @-@ marie nielly had sailed from rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid @-@ atlantic . this left villaret with 25 ships of the line at brest to meet the threat posed by the british fleet under lord howe . \\n  = = = convoy = = = \\n  by early spring of 1794 , the situation in france was dire . with famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of french ports and trade , the french government was forced to look overseas for sustenance . turning to france \\'s colonies in the americas , and the agricultural bounty of the united states , the national convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at hampton roads in the chesapeake bay , where admiral vanstabel would wait for them . according to contemporary historian william james this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong , although he disputes this figure , citing the number as 117 ( in addition to the french warships ) . \\n  the convoy had also been augmented by the united states government , in both cargo and shipping , as repayment for french financial , moral and military support during the american revolution . in supporting the french revolution in this way , the american government , urged especially by ambassador gouverneur morris , was fulfilling its ten @-@ year @-@ old debt to france . friendly relations between the united states and france did not long survive the jay treaty which came into effect in 1796 ; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the quasi war . \\n  = = may 1794 = = \\n  the french convoy , escorted by vanstabel , departed america from virginia on 2 april , and howe sailed from portsmouth on 2 may , taking his entire fleet to both escort british convoys to the western approaches and intercept the french . checking that villaret was still in brest , howe spent two weeks searching the bay of biscay for the grain convoy , returning to brest on 18 may to discover that villaret had sailed the previous day . [ note c ] returning to sea in search of his opponent , howe pursued villaret deep into the atlantic . also at sea during this period were the squadrons of nielly ( french ) and montagu ( british ) , both of whom had met with some success ; nielly had captured a number of british merchant ships and montagu had taken several back . nielly was the first to encounter the grain convoy , deep in the atlantic in the second week of may . he took it under escort as it moved closer to europe , while montagu was searching fruitlessly to the south . \\n  despite howe \\'s pursuit , the main french sortie found initial success , running into a dutch convoy and taking 20 ships from it on villaret \\'s first day at sea . for the next week howe continued to follow the french , seizing and burning a trail of french @-@ held dutch ships and enemy corvettes . on 25 may howe spotted a straggler from villaret \\'s fleet and gave chase ; audacieux led howe straight to his opponent \\'s location . having finally found villaret , on 28 may howe attacked , using a flying squadron of his fastest ships to cut off its rearmost vessel révolutionnaire . this first rate was at various times engaged with six british ships and took heavy damage , possibly striking her colours late in the action . as darkness fell the british and french fleets separated , leaving révolutionnaire and her final enemy , hms audacious , still locked in combat behind them . these two ships parted company during the night and eventually returned to their respective home ports . by this stage villaret knew through his patrolling frigates that the grain convoy was close , and deliberately took his fleet to the west , hoping to decoy howe away from the vital convoy . \\n  taking the bait , the following day howe attacked again , but his attempt to split the french fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship , hms caesar , failed to follow orders . much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive , and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue . howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage , enabling him to further attack villaret at a time of his choosing . three french ships were sent back to port with damage , but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of nielly \\'s detached squadron . battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog , but when the haze lifted on 1 june 1794 , the battle lines were only 6 miles ( 10 km ) apart and howe was prepared to force a decisive action . \\n  = = first of june = = \\n  although howe was in a favourable position , villaret had not been idle during the night . he had attempted , with near success , to distance his ships from the british fleet ; when dawn broke at 05 : 00 he was within a few hours of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon . allowing his men to breakfast , howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with villaret , and by 08 : 12 the british fleet was just four miles ( 6 km ) from the enemy . by this time , howe \\'s formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the french , with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral \\'s commands . the french were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long @-@ range gunfire at 09 : 24 , whereupon howe unleashed his innovative battleplan . \\n  it was normal in fleet actions of the 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately , exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away , often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy . in contrast , howe was counting on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with the advantage of the weather gage to attack the french directly , driving through their line . however , this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters ; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent \\'s force ( as rodney had done at the battle of the saintes 12 years earlier ) . instead , howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the french line , intending to breach it at every point and rake the french ships at both bow and stern . the british captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers , cutting them off from their retreat downwind , and engage them directly , hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the french atlantic fleet . \\n  = = british break the line = = \\n  within minutes of issuing the signal and turning his flagship hms queen charlotte , howe \\'s plan began to falter . many of the british captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging back in the original line . other ships were still struggling with damage from howe \\'s earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough . the result was a ragged formation tipped by queen charlotte that headed unevenly for villaret \\'s fleet . the french responded by firing on the british ships as they approached , but the lack of training and coordination in the french fleet was obvious ; many ships which did obey howe \\'s order and attacked the french directly arrived in action without significant damage . \\n  = = = van squadron = = = \\n  although queen charlotte pressed on all sail , she was not the first through the enemy line . that distinction belonged to a ship of the van squadron under admiral graves : hms defence under captain james gambier , a notoriously dour officer nicknamed \" dismal jimmy \" by his contemporaries . defence , the seventh ship of the british line , successfully cut the french line between its sixth and seventh ships ; mucius and tourville . raking both opponents , defence soon found herself in difficulty due to the failure of those ships behind her to properly follow up . this left her vulnerable to mucius , tourville and the ships following them , with which she began a furious fusillade . however , defence was not the only ship of the van to break the french line ; minutes later george cranfield @-@ berkeley in hms marlborough executed howe \\'s manoeuvre perfectly , raking and then entangling his ship with impétueux . \\n  in front of marlborough the rest of the van had mixed success . hms bellerophon and hms leviathan were both still suffering the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line . instead they pulled along the near side of éole and america respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels . rear @-@ admiral thomas pasley of bellerophon was an early casualty , losing a leg in the opening exchanges . hms royal sovereign , graves \\'s flagship , was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the french line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent terrible . in the time it took to engage terrible more closely , royal sovereign suffered a severe pounding and admiral graves was badly wounded . \\n  more disturbing to lord howe were the actions of hms russell and hms caesar . russell \\'s captain john willett payne was criticised at the time for failing to get to grips with the enemy more closely and allowing her opponent téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages , although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 may for her poor start to the action . there were no such excuses , however , for captain anthony molloy of caesar , who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy . molloy completely ignored howe \\'s signal and continued ahead as if the british battleline was following him rather than engaging the french fleet directly . caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading french ship trajan but her fire had little effect , while trajan inflicted much damage to caesar \\'s rigging and was subsequently able to attack bellerophon as well , roaming unchecked through the melee developing at the head of the line . \\n  = = = centre = = = \\n  the centre of the two fleets was divided by two separate squadrons of the british line : the forward division under admirals benjamin caldwell and george bowyer and the rear under lord howe . while howe in queen charlotte was engaging the french closely , his subordinates in the forward division were less active . instead of moving in on their opposite numbers directly , the forward division sedately closed with the french in line ahead formation , engaging in a long distance duel which did not prevent their opponents from harassing the embattled defence just ahead of them . of all the ships in this squadron only hms invincible , under thomas pakenham , ranged close to the french lines . invincible was badly damaged by her lone charge but managed to engage the larger juste . hms barfleur under bowyer did later enter the action , but bowyer was not present , having lost a leg in the opening exchanges . \\n  howe and queen charlotte led the fleet by example , sailing directly at the french flagship montagne . passing between montagne and the next in line vengeur du peuple , queen charlotte raked both and hauled up close to montagne to engage in a close @-@ range artillery battle . as she did so , queen charlotte also became briefly entangled with jacobin , and exchanged fire with her too , causing serious damage to both french ships . \\n  to the right of queen charlotte , hms brunswick had initially struggled to join the action . labouring behind the flagship , her captain john harvey received a rebuke from howe for the delay . spurred by this signal , harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped queen charlotte , blocking her view of the eastern half of the french fleet for a time and taking severe damage from french fire as she did so . harvey hoped to run aboard jacobin and support his admiral directly , but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between achille and vengeur du peuple . this manoeuvre failed when brunswick \\'s anchors became entangled in vengeur \\'s rigging . harvey \\'s master asked if vengeur should be cut loose , to which harvey replied \" no ; we have got her and we will keep her \" . the two ships swung so close to each other that brunswick \\'s crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids , the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet . \\n  behind this combat , other ships of the centre division struck the french line , hms valiant under thomas pringle passing close to patriote which pulled away , her crew suffering from contagion and unable to take their ship into battle . valiant instead turned her attention on achille , which had already been raked by queen charlotte and brunswick , and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division . hms orion under john thomas duckworth and hms queen under admiral alan gardner both attacked the same ship , queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain john hutt mortally wounded . both ships bore down on the french northumberland , which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast . queen was too slow to engage northumberland as closely as orion , and soon fell in with jemmappes , both ships battering each other severely . \\n  = = = rear = = = \\n  of the british rear ships , only two made a determined effort to break the french line . admiral hood \\'s flagship hms royal george pierced it between républicain and sans pareil , engaging both closely , while hms glory came through the line behind sans pareil and threw herself into the melee as well . the rest of the british and french rearguard did not participate in this close combat ; hms montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with neptune which damaged neither ship severely , although the british captain james montagu was killed in the opening exchanges , command devolving on lieutenant ross donnelly . next in line , hms ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west , captain henry harvey seeking brunswick , his brother \\'s ship , in the confused action around queen charlotte . \\n  three other british ships failed to respond to the signal from howe , including hms alfred which engaged the french line at extreme range without noticeable effect , and captain charles cotton in hms majestic who likewise did little until the action was decided , at which point he took the surrender of several already shattered french ships . finally hms thunderer under albemarle bertie took no part in the initial action at all , standing well away from the british line and failing to engage the enemy despite the signal for close engagement hanging limply from her mainmast . the french rear ships were no less idle , with entreprenant and pelletier firing at any british ships in range but refusing to close or participate in the melees on either side . the french rear ship scipion did not attempt to join the action either , but could not avoid becoming embroiled in the group around royal george and républicain and suffered severe damage . \\n  = = melee = = \\n  within an hour of their opening volleys the british and french lines were hopelessly confused , with three separate engagements being fought within sight of one another . in the van , caesar had finally attempted to join the fight , only to have a vital spar shot away by trajan which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle . bellerophon and leviathan were in the thick of the action , the outnumbered bellerophon taking serious damage to her rigging . this left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents , of which eole also suffered severely . captain william johnstone hope sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support ; the frigate hms latona under captain edward thornbrough arrived to provide assistance . thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the french battleline and opened fire on eole , helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing bellerophon to safety . leviathan , under lord hugh seymour , had been more successful than bellerophon , her gunnery dismasting america despite receiving fire from eole and trajan in passing . leviathan only left america after a two @-@ hour duel , sailing at 11 : 50 to join queen charlotte in the centre . \\n  russell had not broken the french line and her opponent témeraire got the better of her , knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with trajan and eole . russell then fired on several passing french ships before joining leviathan in attacking the centre of the french line . russell \\'s boats also took the surrender of america , her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize ( although later replaced by men from royal sovereign ) . royal sovereign lost admiral graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well , as terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of french ships forming a new line on the far side of the action . villaret was leading this line in his flagship montagne , which had escaped from queen charlotte , and it was montagne which royal sovereign engaged next , pursuing her close to the new french line accompanied by valiant , and beginning a long @-@ range action . \\n  behind royal sovereign was marlborough , inextricably tangled with impétueux . badly damaged and on the verge of surrender , impétueux was briefly reprieved when mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships . the three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time , all suffering heavy casualties with marlborough and impétueux losing all three of their masts . this combat continued for several hours . captain berkeley of marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds , and command fell to lieutenant john monkton , who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve . robert stopford responded in hms aquilon , which had the assignment of repeating signals , and towed marlborough out of the line as mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped french fleet to the north . impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all , and was soon seized by sailors from hms russell . \\n  dismasted , defence was unable to hold any of her various opponents to a protracted duel , and by 13 : 00 was threatened by the damaged républicain moving from the east . although républicain later hauled off to join villaret to the north , gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet \\'s frigates and was aided by hms phaeton under captain william bentinck . as impétueux passed she fired on phaeton , to which bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own . invincible , the only ship of the forward division of the british centre to engage the enemy closely , became embroiled in the confusion surrounding queen charlotte . invincible \\'s guns drove juste onto the broadside of queen charlotte , where she was forced to surrender to lieutenant henry blackwood in a boat from invincible . among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties , although hms impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers , lieutenant robert otway and midshipman charles dashwood . \\n  the conflict between queen charlotte and montagne was oddly one @-@ sided , the french flagship failing to make use of her lower @-@ deck guns and consequently suffering extensive damage and casualties . queen charlotte in her turn was damaged by fire from nearby ships and was therefore unable to follow when montagne set her remaining sails and slipped to the north to create a new focal point for the survivors of the french fleet . queen charlotte also took fire during the engagement from hms gibraltar , under thomas mackenzie , which had failed to close with the enemy and instead fired at random into the smoke bank surrounding the flagship . captain sir andrew snape douglas was seriously wounded by this fire . following montagne \\'s escape , queen charlotte engaged jacobin and républicain as they passed , and was successful in forcing the surrender of juste . to the east of queen charlotte , brunswick and vengeur du peuple continued their bitter combat , locked together and firing main broadsides from point blank range . captain harvey of brunswick was mortally wounded early in this action by langrage fire from vengeur , but refused to quit the deck , ordering more fire into his opponent . brunswick also managed to drive achille off from her far side when the french ship attempted to intervene . achille , already damaged , was totally dismasted in the exchange and briefly surrendered , although her crew rescinded this when it became clear brunswick was in no position to take possession . with her colours rehoisted , achille then made what sail she could in an attempt to join villaret to the north . it was not until 12 : 45 that the shattered vengeur and brunswick pulled apart , both largely dismasted and very battered . brunswick was only able to return to the british side of the line after being supported by ramillies , while vengeur was unable to move at all . ramillies took vengeur \\'s surrender after a brief cannonade but was unable to board her and instead pursued the fleeing achille , which soon surrendered as well . \\n  to the east , orion and queen forced the surrender of both northumberland and jemmappes , although queen was unable to secure jemmappes and she had to be abandoned later . queen especially was badly damaged and unable to make the british lines again , wallowing between the newly reformed french fleet and the british battleline along with several other shattered ships . royal george and glory had between them disabled scipion and sans pareil in a bitter exchange , but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession . all four ships were among those left drifting in the gap between the fleets . \\n  = = french recovery = = \\n  villaret in montagne , having successfully broken contact with the british flagship and slipped away to the north , managed to gather 11 ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron . at 11 : 30 , with the main action drawing to a close , he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered . aiming his new squadron at the battered queen , villaret \\'s attack created consternation in the british fleet , which was unprepared for a second engagement . however , discerning villaret \\'s intention , howe also pulled his ships together to create a new force . his reformed squadron consisted of queen charlotte , royal sovereign , valiant , leviathan , barfleur , and thunderer . howe deployed this squadron in defence of queen , and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape british pursuit . villaret was subsequently joined by the battered terrible , which sailed straight through the dispersed british fleet to reach the french lines , and he also recovered the dismasted scipion , mucius , jemmappes , and républicain — all of which lay within reach of the unengaged british ships — before turning eastwards towards france . at this stage of the battle , howe retired below and the british consolidation was left to his captain of the fleet , sir roger curtis . curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the navy for not capturing more of the dismasted french ships , and was also accused of dissuading howe from attempting further pursuit . \\n  in fact , the british fleet was unable to pursue villaret , having only 11 ships still capable of battle to the french 12 , and having numerous dismasted ships and prizes to protect . retiring and regrouping , the british crews set about making hasty repairs and securing their prizes ; seven in total , including the badly damaged vengeur du peuple . vengeur had been holed by cannon firing from brunswick directly through the ship \\'s bottom , and after her surrender no british ship had managed to get men aboard . this left vengeur \\'s few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could — a task made harder when some of her sailors broke into the spirit room and became drunk . ultimately the ship \\'s pumps became unmanageable , and vengeur began to sink . only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged alfred and hms culloden , as well as the services of the cutter hms rattler , saved any of the vengeur \\'s crew from drowning , these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them . lieutenant john winne of rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work . by 18 : 15 , vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded , the dead , and the drunk remained aboard . several sailors are said to have waved the tricolor from the bow of the ship and cried \" vive la nation , vive la république ! \" \\n  having escaped to the east , villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to france , and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy . villaret was also hoping for reinforcements ; eight ships of the line , commanded by admiral pierre @-@ françois cornic , were patrolling near the ushant headland . behind him to the west , the british took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes , not setting out to return to britain until 05 : 00 on 2 june . \\n  casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly . with only one exception ( scipion ) , records made by the french captains of their losses at the time are incomplete . the only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of saint @-@ andré and the records made by british officers aboard the captured ships , neither of which can be treated as completely reliable . most sources accept that french casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7 @,@ 000 , including around 3 @,@ 000 captured , but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details . british casualties are easier to confirm but here , too , there are some discrepancies ; overall british casualties are generally given as around 1 @,@ 200 . \\n  = = the convoy arrives = = \\n  with a large portion of his fleet no longer battleworthy , howe was unable to resume his search for the french convoy in the bay of biscay . the admiralty , though unaware of howe \\'s specific circumstances , knew a battle had taken place through the arrival of hms audacious in portsmouth , and was preparing a second expedition under george montagu . montagu had returned to england after his unsuccessful may cruise , and was refitting in portsmouth when ordered to sea again . his force of ten ships was intended to both cover howe \\'s withdrawal from biscay , and find and attack the french grain convoy . montagu returned to sea on 3 june , and by 8 june was off ushant searching for signs of either the french or howe ; unknown to him , neither had yet entered european waters . at 15 : 30 on 8 june montagu spotted sails , and soon identified them as the enemy . he had located cornic \\'s squadron , which was also patrolling for the convoy and the returning fleets . montagu gave chase and drove cornic into bertheaume bay , where he blockaded the french squadron overnight , hoping to bring them to action the following day . however , on 9 june , montagu sighted 19 french ships appearing from the west — the remnants of villaret \\'s fleet . hastily turning his ships , montagu sailed south to avoid becoming trapped between two forces which might easily overwhelm him . villaret and cornic gave chase for a day before turning east towards the safety of the french ports . \\n  howe benefited from montagu \\'s withdrawal , as his own battered fleet passed close to the scene of this stand @-@ off on 10 june , pushing north into the english channel . with villaret and cornic fortuitously pursuing montagu to the south , howe was free to pass ushant without difficulty and arrived off plymouth on 12 june , joined soon afterwards by montagu . villaret had anchored with cornic in bertheaume bay the day before , but saint @-@ andré refused to allow him to enter brest until the republican attitudes of the town \\'s population had been assessed . on 12 june , the convoy from america finally arrived off france , having lost just one ship in passage during a storm . \\n  = = aftermath = = \\n  both britain and france claimed victory in the battle : britain by virtue of capturing or sinking seven french ships without losing any of her own and remaining in control of the battle site ; france because the vital convoy had passed through the atlantic unharmed and arrived in france without significant loss . the two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting . the british fleet in spithead was treated with a royal visit by king george iii and the entire royal household . \\n  = = = france = = = \\n  in france the revolutionary principles of égalité precluded extensive awards , but villaret was promoted to vice @-@ admiral on 27 september 1794 and other minor awards were distributed to the admirals of the fleet . in addition the fleet \\'s officers took part in a celebratory parade from brest to paris , accompanying the recently arrived food supplies . the role of vengeur du peuple was mythified by bertrand barrère , giving birth to an exalted legend . opinion in france concerning the battle \\'s outcome was divided ; while many celebrated saint @-@ andré \\'s exaggerated accounts of victory in le moniteur , senior naval officers disagreed . among the dissenters was the highly experienced but recently dismissed admiral kerguelen . kerguelen was disgusted by villaret \\'s failure to renew the battle after he had reformed his squadron , and felt that the french fleet could have been successful tactically as well as strategically if only villaret had made greater efforts to engage the remains of howe \\'s fleet . the french navy had suffered its worst losses in a single day since the battle of la hogue in 1692 . \\n  ultimately the revolutionary excesses of the period would prove disastrous for the french navy . poor leadership , conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the french officer corps . the french battlefleet did not contest british dominance in northern european waters again , and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident british squadrons and the unforgiving atlantic weather . by 1805 , when the last great french fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the battle of trafalgar , poor training and low investment in the navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20 years earlier . \\n  = = = britain = = = \\n  in britain , numerous honours were bestowed on the fleet and its commanders . admiral howe , already an earl , refused any further elevation , and king george iii was dissuaded from making him a knight of the garter by one of howe \\'s political opponents . vice @-@ admiral graves was elevated to the peerage of ireland as baron graves , while vice @-@ admiral hood was made viscount bridport . rear @-@ admirals bowyer , gardner , pasley and curtis ( the last @-@ named was promoted from captain on 4 july 1794 ) were all made baronets , and bowyer and pasley also received pensions of £ 1 @,@ 000 a year to compensate them for their severe wounds . all first lieutenants were promoted to commander and numerous other officers were promoted in consequence of their actions . the thanks of parliament were unanimously passed to all who fought at the action and various other gifts and awards were distributed among the fleet . a memorial to captains john hutt and john harvey , both of whom had died of their wounds on 30 june , was raised in westminster abbey . \\n  there was , however , a bitter consequence of the awards , rooted in howe \\'s official dispatch to the admiralty concerning the battle , which according to some accounts was actually written by curtis . howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle . the list included vice @-@ admirals graves and hood , rear @-@ admirals bowyer , gardner , and pasley , and captains seymour , pakenham , cranfield @-@ berkeley , gambier , john harvey , payne , henry harvey , pringle , duckworth , elphinstone , nichols , and hope . also mentioned were lieutenants monkton and donnelly . the list had omitted a number of officers who had served in the battle , and the justice of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the navy . rear @-@ admiral caldwell was the sole british flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour , although he was promoted to vice @-@ admiral on 4 july ( as were bowyer and gardner ) . after studying the ship \\'s logs and reports of the battle , the admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only ( although captain william parker of hms audacious was awarded one as well ) . the captains excluded from the list were furious , and the furor from this selective commendation lasted years : in 1795 vice @-@ admiral caldwell quit the service in anger as a result , while cuthbert collingwood , flag captain of barfleur , refused all awards for future service until the glorious first of june medal was presented to him as well . he eventually received it after the battle of cape st vincent in 1797 . over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the naval general service medal , awarded upon application to all british participants still living in 1847 . \\n  bitterest of all was the whispering campaign directed at anthony molloy , captain of hms caesar . molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow howe \\'s orders on both 29 may and 1 june . molloy \\'s request for an official court @-@ martial to clear his name failed , and although his personal courage was not called into question , his professional ability was . molloy was dismissed from his ship . \\n  of the captured ships , several were purchased and enjoyed long careers in the royal navy , in particular the two 80 @-@ gun ships hms sans pareil which was decommissioned in 1802 but not broken up until 1842 , and hms juste , which was a popular command until her decommissioning in 1802 at the peace of amiens . of the four 74 @-@ gun prizes , achille and northumberland ( both 74s built in the late 1770s ) were broken up as unserviceable soon after arrival in britain , while impétueux was destroyed in a dockyard fire on 24 august 1794 while undergoing repairs . america , the final prize , was taken into the royal navy as hms america but renamed hms impetueux in july 1795 and remained in service until 1813 . the combined prize money for these ships was £ 201 @,@ 096 ( the equivalent of £ 21 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , divided among the ships under lord howe \\'s command . \\n  = new york state route 368 = \\n  new york

served a small number of homes as it crossed a conrail railroad line ( now part of the finger lakes railway ) at the center of the community . outside of halfway , the route turned to the northwest toward the village of elbridge , avoiding a marshy area directly north of halfway . it intersected with lynch road and campbell road before turning slightly northward and following carpenter \\'s

to onondaga county as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . the county also assumed ownership and maintenance of the onondaga county portion of ny 31b as part of

the united states government that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during world war ii . from 1941 to 1947 , nearly 12 @,@ 000 draftees , willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service , accepted assignments in work of national importance in 152 cps camps throughout the united states and puerto rico . draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked in areas such as soil conservation , forestry , fire fighting , agriculture , under the supervision of such agencies as the u.s. forest service , the soil conservation service , and the national park service . others helped provide social services and mental health services . \\n  the cps men served without wages and minimal support from the federal government . the cost of maintaining the cps camps and providing for the needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families . cps men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well after the end of the war . initially skeptical of the program , government agencies learned to appreciate the men \\'s service and requested more workers from the program . cps made significant contributions to forest fire prevention , erosion and flood control , medical science and reform of the mental health system . \\n  = = background = = \\n  conscientious objectors ( cos ) refuse to participate in military service because of belief or religious training . during wartime , this stance conflicts with conscription efforts . those

experiences of world war i = = = \\n  the conscription law of world war i provided for noncombatant service for members of a religious organization whose members were forbidden from participating in war of any form . this exemption effectively limited conscientious objector status to members of the historic peace churches : mennonites ( and other anabaptist groups such as hutterites ) , religious society of friends ( quakers ) and church of the brethren . the law gave the president authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role . \\n  conscientious objectors who refused noncombatant service during world war i were imprisoned in military facilities such as fort lewis ( washington ) , alcatraz island ( california ) and fort leavenworth ( kansas ) . the government assumed that cos could be converted into soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps . simultaneously the justice department was preparing to indict 181 mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service . the draftees \\' refusal to put on a uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both the government and the cos . the treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute cos included short rations , solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two hutterite draftees . \\n  = = = preparation for world war ii = = = \\n  after world war i , and with another european war looming , leaders from the historic peace churches met to strategize about how to cooperate with the government to avoid the difficulties of world war i. holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable , they devised a plan of civilian alternative service , based on experience gained by american friends service committee work in europe during and after world war i and forestry service done by russian mennonites in lieu of military service in tsarist russia . \\n  as the united states prepared for another war , the historic peace churches , represented by friends who understood inner dealings of washington d.c. politics , attempted to influence new draft bills to ensure their men could fulfill their duty in an alternative , non @-@ military type of service . on june 20 , 1940 , the burke @-@ wadsworth bill came before congress . the arrangements for conscientious objectors were almost identical to the world war i provisions . \\n  = = = selective service act = = = \\n  the friends representatives continued attempting to make the bill more favorable to the historic peace churches . the burke @-@ wadsworth bill passed on september 14 , 1940 , becoming the selective training and service act of 1940 . the influence of the churches was evident in section 5 ( g ) , which says in part : \\n  any such person claiming such exemption from combatant training and service ... in lieu of such induction , be assigned to work of national importance under civilian direction . \\n  the bill offered four improvements from the perspective of the churches over the world war i provisions . the exemption applied to conscientious objection based on religious training or belief , opening the door for members of any religious denomination to apply for co status . draftees turned down by local draft board could appeal under the new law . those assigned to \" work of national importance \" would be under civilian , not military , control and violations of law on the part of those in the program were subject to normal federal jurisdiction , not the military justice system . from the military perspective , it removed the burden of dealing with thousands of uncooperative draftees and segregated the cos and their philosophy from military service members . \\n  unlike harsher methods , the military found that this gentler approach resulted in about one in eight eventually transferring to military service . \\n  = = organization = = \\n  when registration commenced on october 16 , 1940 , no structure was in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors . church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program , and the churches were advised to create a plan . because the government wanted to deal with one body , not individual religious denominations , the national council for religious conscientious objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government . the historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining cps camps under church control . however , president roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees . to save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program , the churches offered to fund the camps . aides convinced roosevelt that putting the cos to work in out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of world war i. selective service and the peace churches agreed to a six @-@ month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus civilian public service was born . \\n  the first camp opened on may 15 , 1941 near baltimore , maryland . a total of 152 camps and units were established over the next six years . the federal government provided work projects , housing , camp furnishings and paid for transportation to the camps . the responsibilities of the churches included day @-@ to @-@ day management of the camps ,

their daily assignments . sites were located typically in rural areas near the agricultural , soil conservation and forestry projects where the work took place . a large camp such as number 57 near hill city , south dakota , had five dormitories and housed as many as 172 men building the deerfield dam . later , with projects located in urban areas , the men lived in smaller units , communal housing near their assignments . cps men typically worked nine hours , six days per week . \\n  mennonite central committee , american friends service committee and brethren service committee administered almost all of the camps . the association of catholic conscientious objectors managed four camps and the methodist world peace commission two . each camp was assigned a director responsible for supervising camp operation . the director managed the needs of the men , oversaw maintenance of the camp facilities , handled community relations and reported to selective service officials . initially a pastor had the camp director role . later , capable men from among the cps workers directed the camps . \\n  besides the director , a matron , business manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp . an educational director was responsible for creating recreational , social and educational programs for the men . church history , bible and first aid were standard course topics . the strength of instructional programs varied from camp to camp , and after nine hours of physical labor , it could be difficult to motivate the men to attend classes . most camps had libraries , some showed current films and camp number 56 ( camp angel ) near waldport , oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts . camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences . \\n  the camp dietitian , with the help of men assigned as cooks , prepared all of the meals . camps with large gardens provided their own fresh vegetables . sponsoring congregations also supplied home canned and fresh produce . the camps were subject to the same shortages and rationing as the rest of the nation . \\n  sunday worship services were organized by the camp director if he was a pastor , by a visiting pastor , or by the cps men themselves . while the historic peace churches organized the cps , 38 % of the men came from other denominations and 4 % claimed no religious affiliation . \\n  men spent their free time doing crafts such as woodworking , rugmaking , leatherwork and photography . outdoor activities included hiking and swimming . men formed choirs and music ensembles , performing in neighboring towns when relations were good . the men earned two days of furlough for each month of service . these days could be saved to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home or in some cases traded to other men in exchange for cash . \\n  men with wives and dependents found it difficult to support their families . beyond a small allowance , the men did not get paid for their service , nor were their dependents given an allowance . to be closer to their husbands , women sought employment near their husband \\'s assignment . later , when jobs on dairy farms became available , families could live together in housing provided for farm workers . \\n  men who became uncooperative with the cps system and were unable to adjust to the church @-@ managed camps were reassigned to a few camps managed by the selective service system . these camps tended to be the least productive and most difficult to administer . men who felt compelled to protest the restrictions of the conscription law attempted to disrupt the program through the use of various techniques , including the initiation of work slowdowns and labor strikes . routine rule breaking frustrated camp directors . the most difficult cases were given to the federal court system and the men imprisoned . \\n  = = = finances = = = \\n  churches were primarily responsible for financing civilian public service , providing for the men \\'s food , clothes , and other material needs . the churches also provided and paid for the camp director . the men received an allowance of between $ 2 @.@ 50 and $ 5 @.@ 00 monthly for personal needs . when jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities , those willing to work beyond their regular cps jobs could earn extra spending money . the federal government spent $ 1 @.@ 3 million on the cps program . the men performed $ 6 million of unpaid labor in return . \\n  men who worked for farmers or psychiatric hospitals received regular wages , which they were required to give to the federal government . objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war . a compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until after the end of the war . at one point , church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men \\'s dependents . \\n  = = types of work = = \\n  the first civilian public service projects were in rural areas where the men performed tasks related to soil

on dairy farms and with milk testing . labor @-@ intensive farming operations like dairies were short of workers and accepted cos to help fill the gap . men assigned to the bureau of reclamation built contours to prevent soil erosion , constructed 164 reservoirs and 249 dams . a sixth of all cps work was performed in this area . \\n  = = = forestry and national parks = = = \\n  at forest service and national park service camps , cps men were responsible for fire control . between fires they built forest trails , cared for nursery stock , planted thousands of seedlings and engaged in pest control . campgrounds and roadways on the blue ridge parkway and skyline drive of virginia are products of cps labor . \\n  hundreds of men volunteered for smoke jumping , showing their willingness to take great personal risks . when fire was detected by a lookout , smoke jumpers were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire . from base camps scattered through the forests of montana , idaho and oregon , the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites , carrying firefighting tools and a two @-@ day supply of k @-@ rations . for larger fires , additional men , supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort . up to 240 cps men served in this specialized program . one of the smokejumping schools was at camp paxson in montana . \\n  = = = mental health = = = \\n  as the war progressed , a critical shortage of workers in psychiatric hospitals developed , because staff had left for better paying jobs with fewer hours and improved working conditions . understaffed wards at philadelphia state hospital had one attendant member for 300 patients , the minimum ratio being 10 : 1 . the government balked at initial requests that cps workers have these positions , believing it better to keep the men segregated in the rural camps to prevent the spread of their philosophy . \\n  eventually the men received permission to work for the mental institutions as attendants or psychiatric aides . individuals who found jobs at the rural camps unfulfilling and meaningless , volunteered for this new type of assignment . the mental health field promised to provide the work of national importance that the program was designed to produce . by the end of 1945 , more than 2000 cps men worked in 41 institutions in 20 states . \\n  the cps men discovered appalling conditions in the mental hospital wards . in an interview , a conscientious objector described his experience when he first entered a mental hospital in october 1942 : \\n  it is sort of like a perpetual bad dream . the smells , the sounds of the insane voices , the bad equipment . the long , dark corridors . i tell you , it is all very much like a medieval fairytale of the nether regions . we ’ d heard about how these patients had been treated by the attendants , beat with rods , you know , do all kind of things . we took a vow before we left the camp , we decided that we would not assault or in any way , strike a patient . \\n  i opened one of those rooms , and there was a man lying on the floor . i leaned over to try to see what i could do to minister to him in some way , do something for him . he may have been on a mattress or he may have been on the bare floor . no he was on the bare floor , because when i tried to move him , his skin came off . his skin was bloody and stuck to the floor and when i tried to lift him up it just peeled his skin off . he was in the last stages of syphilis . he died less than a week afterwards . now that was my first introduction to what was badly needed in that institution . \\n  the cps men objected to the mistreatment and abuse of patients and determined to improve conditions in the psychiatric wards . they wanted to show other attendants alternatives to violence when dealing with patients . \\n  frank olmstead , chairman of the war resisters league observed : \\n  one objector assigned to a violent ward refused to take the broomstick offered by the charge . when he entered the ward the patients crowded around asking , \" where is your broomstick ? \" he said he thought he would not need it . \" but suppose some of us gang up on you ? \" the co guessed they wouldn \\'t do that and started talking about other things . within a few days the patients were seen gathering around the unarmed attendant telling him of their troubles . he felt much safer than the charge who had only his broomstick for company . \\n  outraged workers surveyed cps men in other hospitals and learned of the degree of abuse throughout the psychiatric care system . contacting church managers and government officials , the cos begin advocating for reforms to end the abuses . conditions were exposed in institutions such as cleveland state hospital , eastern state hospital in virginia and hudson river state hospital . one explained : \\n  and the governor came in and they cleaned out the hospital . i mean , they had hearings . we all had to appear in court and all that kind of stuff . and within a month or so , the hospital was completely changed . the superintendent was fired and the new superintendent was put in , and not only did they do our hospital , they did all the hospitals , mental hospitals in virginia . \\n  the reformers were especially active at the byberry hospital in philadelphia where four friends initiated the the attendant magazine as a way to communicate ideas and promote reform . this periodical later became the psychiatric aide , a professional journal for mental health workers . on may 6 , 1946 life magazine printed an exposé of the mental healthcare system based on the reports of cos . another effort of cps , mental hygiene project became the national mental health foundation . initially skeptical about the value of civilian public service , eleanor roosevelt , impressed by the changes introduced by cos in the mental health system , became a sponsor of the national mental health foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including owen j. roberts , pearl buck and harry emerson fosdick to join her in advancing the organization \\'s objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients . \\n  = = = medical experiments = = = \\n  draftees in civilian public service became medical and scientific research test subjects in human medical experiments under the direction of the office of scientific research and development and the surgeon general at medical institutions such as harvard medical school , yale and stanford universities , and massachusetts general hospital . these experiments involved a range of research topics , sometimes endangering the health of the cos . \\n  hepatitis : during the 1940s the cause , method of communication and treatment of infectious hepatitis was not well understood . experimentation began with cos working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with 30 to 60 test subjects at the university of pennsylvania and yale university . the men were inoculated with infected blood plasma , swallowed nose and throat washings and the human body wastes of infected patients , and drank contaminated water . \\n  as a young surgeon , c. everett koop was part of the research team at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine . he related his experience with cps test subjects : \\n  and the first time i was introduced to this whole program when i as a young surgeon , was asked to do serial biopsies on their livers to see what the effect of the virus was in the production of the changes in the liver . and in that way , i got to know that a lot of these young men had no idea that the risk they were taking also included death . and some of those youngsters did die and it was a very difficult thing for me to be part of , because you know , you ’ re powerless , when you ’ re part of the big team . \\n  it couldn \\'t happen today . internal review boards would not permit the use of a live virus in human subjects unless they really understood what was going to happen to them . and i doubt that even if they knew what the risk was , that an internal review board in any academic institution would consent to that kind of experimental work . \\n  the hepatitis research was instrumental in determining a virus is responsible for the disease and that it is transmitted through human filth , serum and drinking water . \\n  malaria : during the early 1940s , quinine was the chief anti @-@ malarial drug . made from the bark of the south american cinchona tree , quinine was in short supply during the war , so scientists began searching for an alternative treatment . the test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days , were given experimental treatments . at the university of minnesota , twelve cps men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria . this research documented the debilitating effects of the disease and the amount of time required for a complete recovery . \\n  common cold and atypical pneumonia : a hundred cps men participated with tests such that they inhaled or drank throat washings from soldiers with colds and pneumonia . this research proved that colds and some types of pneumonia are cause by a virus , not bacteria . \\n  minnesota starvation experiment : to study the effects of diet and nutrition , dr. ancel keys of the university of minnesota laboratory of physiological hygiene placed 32 conscientious objectors on a controlled diet . for three months they were given a normal 3 @,@ 200 calories ( 13 @,@ 000 kj ) diet . this was followed by six months of an 1 @,@ 800 calories ( 7 @,@ 500 kj ) diet , fewer calories than provided by the famine diet experienced by the civilian population in wartime europe . the research documented the men \\'s ability to maintain physical output and the psychological effects such as introversion , lethargy , irritability and severe depression . the study then followed the men \\'s long recovery as they returned to a normal diet and regained the weight lost during the experimentation . \\n  the study provided valuable insights into hunger and starvation and the results were made available to all major relief agencies concerned with postwar food and nutrition problems , helping to inspire the marshall plan . \\n  = = closure and impact = = \\n  civilian public service men were released from their assignments and the camps closed during march 1947 , nineteen months after the end of the war in the pacific . reforms in the mental health system continued after the war . the experience of mennonite cos was instrumental in creating regional mental health facilities in california , kansas and maryland . \\n  lewis hill , who was in cps camp number 37 near coleville , california , together with several other cos founded pacifica network and kpfa radio in berkeley , california , the world \\'s first listener @-@ sponsored radio station . poets william everson and william stafford were both in cps camps . actor francis ( fritz ) william weaver spent time in the big flats ( new york ) cps camp number 46 . \\n  men from the historic peace churches volunteered for relief and reconstruction after their release from cps . the 1947 nobel peace prize was awarded to american and british friends service committees for their relief work in europe after the war . mennonite central committee redirected its effort from camp administration to relief and reconstruction in europe after the war . \\n  civilian public service created a precedent for the alternative service program for conscientious objectors in the united states during the korean and vietnam wars . although the cps program was not duplicated , the idea of offering men an opportunity to do \" work of national importance \" instead of military service was established . \\n  = ireland = \\n  ireland ( / ˈaɪərlənd / ; irish : éire [ ˈeːɾʲə ] ; ulster @-@ scots : airlann [ ˈɑːrlən ] ) is an island in the north atlantic . it is separated from great britain to its east by the north channel , the irish sea , and st george \\'s channel . ireland is the second @-@ largest island of the british isles , the third @-@ largest in europe , and the twentieth @-@ largest on earth . \\n  politically , ireland is divided between the republic of ireland ( officially named ireland ) , which covers five @-@ sixths of the island , and northern ireland , which is part of the united kingdom , in the northeast of the island . in 2011 the population of ireland was about 6 @.@ 4 million , ranking it the second @-@ most populous island in europe after great britain . just under 4 @.@ 6 million live in the republic of ireland and just over 1 @.@ 8 million live in northern ireland . \\n  the island \\'s geography comprises relatively low @-@ lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . the island has lush vegetation , a product of its mild but changeable climate which avoids extremes in temperature . thick woodlands covered the island until the middle ages . as of 2013 , the amount of land that is wooded in ireland is about 11 % of the total , compared with a european average of 35 % . there are twenty @-@ six extant mammal species native to ireland . the irish climate is very moderated and classified as oceanic . as a result , winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area . however , summers are cooler than those in continental europe . rainfall and cloud cover are abundant . \\n  the earliest evidence of human presence in ireland is dated at 10 @,@ 500 bc . gaelic ireland had emerged by the 1st century ad and lasted until the first world war . the island was christianised from the 5th century onward . following the norman invasion in the 12th century , england claimed sovereignty over ireland . however , english rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th – 17th century tudor conquest , which led to colonisation by settlers from britain . in the 1690s , a system of protestant english rule was designed to materially disadvantage the catholic majority and protestant dissenters , and was extended during the 18th century . with the acts of union in 1801 , ireland became a part of the united kingdom . a war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island , creating the irish free state , which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades , and northern ireland , which remained a part of the united kingdom . northern ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s . this subsided following a political agreement in 1998 . in 1973 the republic of ireland joined the european economic community while the united kingdom , and northern ireland , as part of it , did the same . \\n  irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures , especially in the fields of literature . alongside mainstream western culture , a strong indigenous culture exists , as expressed through gaelic games , irish music , and the irish language . the culture of the island also shares many features with that of great britain , including the english language , and sports such as association football , rugby , horse racing , and golf . \\n  = = name = = \\n  ireland consists of old irish eriu + english land . eriu

= = prehistoric ireland = = = \\n  during the last glacial period , and up until about 9000 years ago , most of ireland was covered with ice , most of the time . sea levels were lower and ireland , like great britain , formed part of continental europe . by 12 @,@ 000 bc , rising sea levels due to ice melting caused ireland to become separated from great britain . later , around 5600 bc , great britain itself became separated from continental europe . the earliest evidence of human presence in ireland is dated at 10 @,@ 500 bc . until recently the earliest evidence of humans in ireland were mesolithic people who arrived by boat from britain between 8000 bc and 7000 bc . \\n  from about 4500 bc , neolithic settlers arrived introducing cereal cultivars , a housing culture ( similar to those of the same period in scotland ) and stone monuments . a more advanced agriculture was to develop . at the céide fields , preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present @-@ day county mayo , is an extensive field system , arguably the oldest in the world , dating from not long after this period . consisting of small divisions separated by dry @-@ stone walls , the fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 bc and 3000 bc . wheat and barley were the principal crops imported from the iberian peninsula . \\n  the bronze age – defined by the use of metal – began around 2500 bc , with technology changing people \\'s everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel , harnessing oxen , weaving textiles , brewing alcohol , and skilful metalworking , which produced new weapons and tools , along with fine gold decoration and jewellery , such as brooches and torcs . according to john t. koch and others , ireland in the late bronze age was part of a maritime trading @-@ networked culture called the atlantic bronze age that also included britain , western france and iberia , and that this is where celtic languages developed . this contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland europe with the hallstatt culture . \\n  = = = = emergence of celtic ireland = = = = \\n  during the iron age , a celtic language and culture emerged in ireland . how and when the island of ireland became celtic has been debated for close to a century , with the migrations of the celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies . today , there is more than one school of thought on how this occurred in ireland . \\n  the long @-@ standing traditional view , once widely accepted , is that celtic language , ogham script and culture were brought to ireland by waves of invading or migrating celts from mainland europe . this theory draws on the lebor gabála érenn , a medieval christian pseudo @-@ history of ireland along with the presence of celtic culture , language and artefacts found in ireland such as celtic bronze spears , shields , torcs and other finely crafted celtic associated possessions . the theory holds that there were four separate celtic invasions of ireland . the priteni were said to be the first , followed by the belgae from northern gaul and britain . later , laighin tribes from armorica ( present @-@ day brittany ) were said to have invaded ireland and britain more or less simultaneously . lastly , the milesians ( gaels ) were said to have reached ireland from either northern iberia or southern gaul . it was claimed that a second wave named the euerni , belonging to the belgae people of northern gaul , began arriving about the sixth century bc . they were said to have given their name to the island . \\n  a more recent theory , with broad support among archaeologists , is that celtic culture and language arrived in ireland as a result of cultural diffusion . this theory proposes that the celticisation of ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between ireland , britain and adjacent parts of continental europe . \\n  the theory was advanced in part because of lack of archeological evidence for large @-@ scale celtic immigration , though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify . some proponents of this theory hold that it is likely that there was migration of smaller groups of celts to ireland , with sufficiently regular traffic to constitute a \" migration stream , \" but that this was not the fundamental cause of insular celticisation . historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of the celtic language , with some saying that an assumed processional view of celtic linguistic formation is \\' an especially hazardous exercise \\' . genetic lineage investigation into the area of celtic migration to ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in mitochondrial dna between ireland and large areas of continental europe , in contrast to parts of the y @-@ chromosome pattern . when taking both into account a recent study drew the conclusion that modern celtic speakers in ireland could be thought of as european \" atlantic celts \" showing a shared ancestry throughout the atlantic zone from northern iberia to western scandinavia rather than substantially central european . \\n  = = = late antiquity and early medieval times = = = \\n  the earliest written records of ireland come from classical greco @-@ roman geographers . ptolemy in his almagest refers to ireland as mikra brettania ( little britain ) , in contrast to the larger island , which he called megale brettania ( great britain ) . in his later work , geography , ptolemy refers to ireland as iouernia and to great britain as albion . these \" new \" names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time . the earlier names , in contrast , were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made . \\n  the romans would later refer to ireland by this name too in its latinised form , hibernia , or scotia . ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting every part of ireland in 100 ad . the relationship between the roman empire and the kingdoms of ancient ireland is unclear . however , a number of finds of roman coins have been made , for example at the iron age settlement of freestone hill near gowran and newgrange . \\n  ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms but , beginning in the 7th century ad , a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a high king of ireland . medieval irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past . \\n  the high king was said to preside over the provincial kingdoms that together formed ireland . all of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the high king . the high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of meath , with a ceremonial capital at the hill of tara . the concept only became a political reality in the viking age and even then was not a consistent one . ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law : the early written judicial system , the brehon laws , administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons . however , a united kingdom of gaelic ireland was never achieved . \\n  the chronicle of ireland records that in 431 ad bishop palladius arrived in ireland on a mission from pope celestine i to minister to the irish \" already believing in christ \" . the same chronicle records that saint patrick , ireland \\'s best known patron saint , arrived the following year . there is continued debate over the missions of palladius and patrick but the consensus is that they both took place and that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion . irish christian scholars excelled in the study of latin and greek learning and christian theology . in the monastic culture that followed the christianisation of ireland , latin and greek learning was preserved in ireland during the early middle ages in contrast to elsewhere in europe , where the dark ages followed the decline of the roman empire . \\n  the arts of manuscript illumination , metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the book of kells , ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today . a mission founded in 563 on iona by the irish monk saint columba began a tradition of irish missionary work that spread celtic christianity and learning to scotland , england and the frankish empire on continental europe after the fall of rome . these missions continued until the late middle ages , establishing monasteries and centres of learning , producing scholars such as sedulius scottus and johannes eriugena and exerting much influence in europe . \\n  from the 9th century , waves of viking raiders plundered irish monasteries and towns . these raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep @-@ seated in ireland . the vikings also were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in ireland : dublin , limerick , cork , wexford , waterford , and also carlingford , strangford , annagassan , arklow , youghal , lough foyle and lough ree . \\n  = = = norman and english invasions = = = \\n  on 1 may 1169 , an expedition of cambro @-@ norman knights with an army of about six hundred landed at bannow strand in present @-@ day county wexford . it was led by richard de clare , called strongbow due to his prowess as an archer . the invasion , which coincided with a period of renewed norman expansion , was at the invitation of dermot mac murrough , the king of leinster . \\n  in 1166 , mac murrough had fled to anjou , france , following a war involving tighearnán ua ruairc , of breifne , and sought the assistance of the angevin king , henry ii , in recapturing his kingdom . in 1171 , henry arrived in ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition . he wanted to re @-@ exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control . henry successfully re @-@ imposed his authority over strongbow and the cambro @-@ norman warlords and persuaded many of the irish kings to accept him as their overlord , an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 treaty of windsor . \\n  the invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the papal bull laudabiliter , issued by adrian iv in 1155 . the bull encouraged henry to take control in ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the irish church and its integration into the roman church system . some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the synod of kells in 1152 . there has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of laudabiliter , and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery . \\n  in 1172 , the new pope , alexander iii , further encouraged henry to advance the integration of the irish church with rome . henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution . this church levy , called peter \\'s pence , is extant in ireland as a voluntary donation . in turn , henry accepted the title of lord of ireland which henry conferred on his younger son , john lackland , in 1185 . this defined the irish state as the lordship of ireland . when henry \\'s successor died unexpectedly in 1199 , john inherited the crown of england and retained the lordship of ireland . \\n  over the century that followed , norman feudal law gradually replaced the gaelic brehon law so that by the late 13th century the norman @-@ irish had established a feudal system throughout much of ireland . norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies , manors , towns and the seeds of the modern county system . a version of the magna carta ( the great charter of ireland ) , substituting dublin for london and irish church for church of england , was published in 1216 and the parliament of ireland was founded in 1297 . \\n  from the mid @-@ 14th century , after the black death , norman settlements in ireland went into a period of decline . the norman rulers and the gaelic irish elites intermarried and the areas under norman rule became gaelicised . in some parts , a hybrid hiberno @-@ norman culture emerged . in response , the irish parliament passed the statutes of kilkenny in 1367 . these were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the normans into irish society by requiring english subjects in ireland to speak english , follow english customs and abide by english law . \\n  by the end of the 15th century central english authority in ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed irish culture and language , albeit with norman influences , was dominant again . english crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around dublin known as the pale , and under the provisions of poynings \\' law of 1494 , the irish parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the english parliament . \\n  = = = the kingdom of ireland = = = \\n  the title of king of ireland was re @-@ created in 1542 by henry viii , then king of england , of the tudor dynasty . english rule of law was reinforced and expanded in ireland during the latter part of the 16th century , leading to the tudor conquest of ireland . a near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century , following the nine years \\' war and the flight of the earls . \\n  this control was further consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century , which witnessed english and scottish colonisation in the plantations of ireland , the wars of the three kingdoms and the williamite war . irish losses during the wars of the three kingdoms ( which , in ireland , included the irish confederacy and the cromwellian conquest of ireland ) are estimated to include 20 @,@ 000 battlefield casualties . 200 @,@ 000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war @-@ related famine , displacement , guerrilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war . a further 50 @,@ 000 were sent into indentured servitude in the west indies . some historians estimate that as much as half of the pre @-@ war population of ireland may have died as a result of the conflict . \\n  the religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in ireland . religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the irish king and parliament . after the passing of the test act 1672 , and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of william and mary over the jacobites , roman catholics and nonconforming protestant dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the irish parliament . under the emerging penal laws , irish roman catholics and dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property . additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703 , 1709 and 1728 . this completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage roman catholics and protestant dissenters , while enriching a new ruling class of anglican conformists . the new anglo @-@ irish ruling class became known as the protestant ascendancy . \\n  an extraordinary climatic shock known as the \" great frost \" struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 , after a decade of relatively mild winters . the winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests . this resulted in the famine of 1740 . an estimated 250 @,@ 000 people ( about one in eight of the population ) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease . the irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more . local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality . \\n  in the aftermath of the famine , an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms . the population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of georgian ireland was built . in 1782 , poynings \\' law was repealed , giving ireland legislative independence from great britain for the first time since 1495 . the british government , however , still retained the right to nominate the government of ireland without the consent of the irish parliament . \\n  = = = union with great britain = = = \\n  in 1798 , members of the protestant dissenter tradition ( mainly presbyterian ) made common cause with roman catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the society of united irishmen , with the aim of creating an independent ireland . despite assistance from france the rebellion was put down by british and irish government and yeomanry forces . in 1800 , the british and irish parliaments both passed acts of union that , with effect from 1 january 1801 , merged the kingdom of ireland and the kingdom of great britain to create a united kingdom of great britain and ireland . \\n  the passage of the act in the irish parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities , having failed on the first attempt in 1799 . according to contemporary documents and historical analysis , this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery , with funding provided by the british secret service office , and the awarding of peerages , places and honours to secure votes . thus , the parliament in ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at westminster in london , though resistance remained , as evidenced by robert emmet \\'s failed irish rebellion of 1803 . \\n  aside from the development of the linen industry , ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution , partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of england , which saw ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital . \\n  the great famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of one million irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it . by the end of the decade , half of all immigration to the united states was from ireland . the period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the land war . mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid @-@ 20th century . immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8 @.@ 2 million by the 1841 census . the population has never returned to this level since . the population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of ireland ( county leitrim ) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so . \\n  the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern irish nationalism , primarily among the roman catholic population . the pre @-@ eminent irish political figure after the union was daniel o \\'connell . he was elected as member of parliament for ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a roman catholic . o \\'connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the prime minister , the irish @-@ born soldier and statesman , the duke of wellington . steering the catholic relief bill through parliament , aided by future prime minister robert peel , wellington prevailed upon a reluctant george iv to sign the bill and proclaim it into law . george \\'s father had opposed the plan of the earlier prime minister , pitt the younger , to introduce such a bill following the union of 1801 , fearing catholic emancipation to be in conflict with the act of settlement 1701 . \\n  daniel o \\'connell led a subsequent campaign , for the repeal of the act of union , which failed . later in the century , charles stewart parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the union , or \" home rule \" . unionists , especially those located in ulster , were strongly opposed to home rule , which they thought would be dominated by catholic interests . after several attempts to pass a home rule bill through parliament , it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914 . to prevent this from happening , the ulster volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of edward carson . \\n  their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the irish volunteers , whose aim was to ensure that the home rule bill was passed . the act was passed but with the \" temporary \" exclusion of the six counties of ulster that would become northern ireland . before it could be implemented , however , the act was suspended for the duration of the first world war . the irish volunteers split into two groups . the majority , approximately 175 @,@ 000 in number , under john redmond , took the name national volunteers and supported irish involvement in the war . a minority , approximately 13 @,@ 000 , retained the irish volunteers \\' name , and opposed ireland \\'s involvement in the war . \\n  the easter rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia , the irish citizen army . the british response , executing fifteen leaders of the rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people , turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels . support for irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in europe , as well as the conscription crisis of 1918 . \\n  the pro @-@ independence republican party , sinn féin , received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918 , and in 1919 proclaimed an irish republic , setting up its own parliament ( dáil éireann ) and government . simultaneously the volunteers , which became known as the irish republican army ( ira ) , launched a three @-@ year guerrilla war , which ended in a truce in july 1921 ( although violence continued until june 1922 , mostly in northern ireland ) . \\n  = = = partition = = = \\n  in december 1921 , the anglo @-@ irish treaty was concluded between the british government and representatives of the second dáil . it gave ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy , but an opt @-@ out clause allowed northern ireland to remain within the united kingdom , which it immediately exercised as expected . additionally , an oath of allegiance to the king was to be taken . disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent irish civil war between the new government of the irish free state and those opposed to the treaty , led by éamon de valera . the civil war officially ended in may 1923 when de valera issued a cease @-@ fire order . \\n  = = = = independence = = = = \\n  during its first decade , the newly formed irish free state was governed by the victors of the civil war . when de valera achieved power , he took advantage of the statute of westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government . the oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted . this completed a process of gradual separation from the british empire that governments had pursued since independence . however , it was not until 1949 that the state was declared , officially , to be the republic of ireland . \\n  the state was neutral during world war ii , but offered clandestine assistance to the allies , particularly in the potential defence of northern ireland . despite their country \\'s neutrality , approximately 50 @,@ 000 volunteers from independent ireland joined the british forces during the war , four being awarded victoria crosses . \\n  the abwehr was also active in ireland . german intelligence operations effectively ended in september 1941 when police made arrests on the basis of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in dublin , including that of the united states . to the authorities , counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence . with a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war , and with limited supplies of modern weapons , the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict . \\n  large @-@ scale emigration marked most of the post @-@ wwii period ( particularly during the 1950s and 1980s ) , but beginning in 1987 the economy improved , and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth . this period of growth became known as the celtic tiger . the republic \\'s real gdp grew by an average of 9 @.@ 6 % per annum between 1995 and 1999 , in which year the republic joined the euro . in 2000 , it was the sixth @-@ richest country in the world in terms of gdp per capita . \\n  social changes also occurred in this time , most markedly with the decline in authority of the catholic church . the financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom . gdp fell by 3 % in 2008 and by 7 @.@ 1 % in 2009 , the worst year since records began ( although earnings by foreign @-@ owned businesses continued to grow ) . the state has since experienced deep recession , with unemployment , which doubled during 2009 , remaining above 14 % in 2012 . \\n  = = = = northern ireland = =

its own parliament and prime minister . northern ireland , as part of the united kingdom , was not neutral during the second world war and belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941 . conscription was not extended to northern ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from northern ireland as volunteered from the south . one , james joseph magennis , received the victoria cross for valour . \\n  although northern ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war , in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter @-@ communal violence . nationalists , mainly roman catholic , wanted to unite ireland as an independent republic , whereas unionists , mainly protestant , wanted northern ireland to remain in the united kingdom . the protestant and catholic communities in northern ireland voted largely along sectarian lines , meaning that the government of northern ireland ( elected by \" first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post \" from 1929 ) was controlled by the ulster unionist party . over time , the minority catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment . \\n  in the late 1960s , nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests , which were often confronted by loyalist counter @-@ protests . the government \\'s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one @-@ sided and heavy @-@ handed in favour of unionists . law and order broke down as unrest and inter @-@ communal violence increased . the northern ireland government requested the british army to aid the police , who were exhausted after several nights of serious rioting . in 1969 , the paramilitary provisional ira , which favoured the creation of a united ireland , emerged from a split in the irish republican army and began a campaign against what it called the \" british occupation of the six counties \" . \\n  other groups , on both the unionist side and the nationalist side , participated in violence and a period known as the troubles began . over 3 @,@ 600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict . owing to the civil unrest during the troubles , the british government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule . there were several unsuccessful attempts to end the troubles politically , such as the sunningdale agreement of 1973 . in 1998 , following a ceasefire by the provisional ira and multi @-@ party talks , the good friday agreement was concluded as a treaty between the british and irish governments , annexing the text agreed in the multi @-@ party talks . \\n  the substance of the agreement ( formally referred to as the belfast agreement ) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of ireland . the agreement restored self @-@ government to northern ireland on the basis of power @-@ sharing in a regional executive drawn from the major parties in a new northern ireland assembly , with entrenched protections for the two main communities . the executive is jointly headed by a first minister and deputy first minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties . violence had decreased greatly after the provisional ira and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the provisional ira announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations . \\n  the assembly and power @-@ sharing executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007 . in that year the british government officially ended its military support of the police in northern ireland ( operation banner ) and began withdrawing troops . on 27 june 2012 ,

turf \" ) as a source of energy for home fires . a form of biomass energy , this source of heat is still widely used in rural areas . however , due to the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity , the eu is attempting to protect this habitat by fining ireland if they are dug up . in cities , heat is generally supplied by heating oil , although some urban suppliers distribute \" sods of turf \" as \" smokeless fuel \" . \\n  an area in which the island operates as a single market is electricity . for much of their existence electricity networks in the republic of ireland and northern ireland were entirely separate . both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition . however , as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through great britain to mainland europe . the situation in northern ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying northern ireland electricity ( nie ) with enough power . in the republic of ireland , the esb has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66 % , one of the worst such rates in western europe . eirgrid is building a hvdc transmission line between ireland and great britain with a capacity of 500 mw , about 10 % of ireland \\'s peak demand . \\n  as with electricity , the natural gas distribution network is also now all @-@ island , with a pipeline linking gormanston , county meath , and ballyclare , county antrim completed in 2007 . most of ireland \\'s gas comes through interconnectors between twynholm in scotland and ballylumford , county antrim and loughshinny , county dublin . a decreasing supply is coming from the kinsale gas field off the county cork coast and the corrib gas field off the coast of county mayo has yet to come on @-@ line . the county mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore . \\n  the republic of ireland has shown a strong commitment to renewable energy , ranking as one of the top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 global green economy index . research and development in ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004 . large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as cork , donegal , mayo and antrim . the construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities , some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly . the republic of ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms . the esb \\'s turlough hill facility is the only power @-@ storage facility in the state . \\n  = = geography = = \\n  the island of ireland is located in the north @-@ west of europe , between latitudes 51 ° and 56 ° n , and longitudes 11 ° and 5 ° w. it is separated from the neighbouring island of great britain by the irish sea and the north channel , which has a width of 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) at its narrowest point . to the west is the northern atlantic ocean and to the south is the celtic sea , which lies between ireland and brittany , in france . ireland has a total area of 84 @,@ 421 km2 ( 32 @,@ 595 sq mi ) . ireland and great britain , together with many nearby smaller islands , are known collectively as the british isles . as the term british isles is controversial in relation to ireland , the alternate term britain and ireland is often used as a neutral term for the islands . \\n  a ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island . the highest of these is carrauntoohil ( irish : corrán tuathail ) in county kerry , which rises to 1 @,@ 038 m ( 3 @,@ 406 ft ) above sea level . the most arable land lies in the province of leinster . western areas can be mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas . the river shannon , the island \\'s longest river at 386 km ( 240 mi ) long , rises in county cavan in the north west and flows 113 kilometres ( 70 mi ) to limerick city in the mid west . \\n  the island \\'s lush vegetation , a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall , earns it the sobriquet the emerald isle . overall , ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes . the climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes . this is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the south @-@ western atlantic . \\n  precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall , particularly in the east . the west tends to be wetter on average and prone to atlantic storms , especially in the late autumn and winter months . these occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas , as well as sometimes snow and hail . the regions of north county galway and east county mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island , with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas . munster , in the south , records the least snow whereas ulster , in the north , records the most . \\n  inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter . usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing 0 ° c ( 32 ° f ) at inland weather stations , compared to 10 days at coastal stations . ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves , most recently in 1995 , 2003 , 2006 and 2013 . in common with the rest of europe , ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2009 / 10 . temperatures fell as low as − 17 @.@ 2 ° c ( 1 ° f ) in county mayo on 20 december and up to a metre ( 3 ft ) of snow fell in mountainous areas . \\n  the island consists of varied geological provinces . in the far west , around county galway and county donegal , is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of caledonide affinity , similar to the scottish highlands . across southeast ulster and extending southwest to longford and south to navan is a province of ordovician and silurian rocks , with similarities to the southern uplands province of scotland . further south , along the county wexford coastline , is an area of granite intrusives into more ordovician and silurian rocks , like that found in wales . \\n  in the southwest , around bantry bay and the mountains of macgillicuddy \\'s reeks , is an area of substantially deformed , but only lightly metamorphosed , devonian @-@ aged rocks . this partial ring of \" hard rock \" geology is covered by a blanket of carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country , giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape . the west @-@ coast district of the burren around lisdoonvarna has well @-@ developed karst features . significant stratiform lead @-@ zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around silvermines and tynagh . \\n  hydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the kinsale head gas field off cork in the mid @-@ 1970s . in 1999 , economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the corrib gas field off the county mayo coast . this has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the \" west of shetland \" step @-@ out development from the north sea hydrocarbon province . the helvick oil field , estimated to contain over 28 million barrels ( 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil , is another recent discovery . \\n  landscapes \\n  = = = places of interest = = = \\n  there are three world heritage sites on the island : the brú na bóinne , skellig michael and the giant \\'s causeway . a number of other places are on the tentative list , for example the burren , the ceide fields and mount stewart . \\n  some of the most visited sites in ireland include bunratty castle , the rock of cashel , the cliffs of moher , holy cross abbey and blarney castle . historically important monastic sites include glendalough and clonmacnoise , which are maintained as national monuments in the republic of ireland . \\n  dublin is the most heavily touristed region and home to several of the most popular attractions such as the guinness storehouse and book of kells . the west and south west , which includes the lakes of killarney and the dingle peninsula in county kerry and connemara and the aran islands in county galway , are also popular tourist destinations . \\n  achill island lies off the coast of county mayo and is ireland \\'s largest island . it is a popular tourist destination for surfing and contains 5 blue flag beaches and croaghaun one of the worlds highest sea cliffs . stately homes , built during the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries in palladian , neoclassical and neo @-@ gothic styles , such as , castle ward , castletown house , bantry house , glenveagh castle are also of interest to tourists . some have been converted into hotels , such as ashford castle , castle leslie and dromoland castle . \\n  world heritage sites \\n  = = flora and fauna = = \\n  because ireland became isolated from mainland europe by rising sea levels before the last ice age had completely finished , it has fewer land animal and plant species than great britain , which separated later , or mainland europe . there are 55 mammal species in ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to ireland . some species , such as , the red fox , hedgehog and badger , are very common , whereas others , like the irish hare , red deer and pine marten are less so . aquatic wildlife , such as species of sea turtle , shark , seal , whale , and dolphin , are common off the coast . about 400 species of birds have been recorded in ireland . many of these are migratory , including the barn swallow . \\n  several different habitat types are found in ireland , including farmland , open woodland , temperate broadleaf and mixed forests , conifer plantations , peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats . however , agriculture drives current land use patterns in ireland , limiting natural habitat preserves , particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs . with no large apex predators in ireland other than humans and dogs , such populations of animals as semi @-@ wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators , such as the fox , are controlled by annual culling . \\n  there are no snakes in ireland and only one species of reptile ( the common lizard ) is native to the island . extinct species include the irish elk , the great auk and the wolf . some previously extinct birds , such as the golden eagle , been reintroduced in about the year 2000 after decades of extirpation . until medieval times ireland was heavily forested with oak , pine and birch . forests today cover about 12 @.@ 6 % of ireland , of which 4 @,@ 450 km ² or one million acres is owned by coillte , the republic \\'s forestry service . \\n  as of 2012 the republic is one of the least forested countries in europe . much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild @-@ flower . gorse ( ulex europaeus ) , a wild furze , is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions , especially in the western parts . it is home to hundreds of plant species , some of them unique to the island , and has been \" invaded \" by some grasses , such as spartina anglica . \\n  the algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold @-@ temperate variety . the total number of species is 574 and is distributed as follows : \\n  264 rhodophyta ( red algae ) \\n  152 phaeophyceae ( brown algae including kelps ) \\n  114 chloropyta ( green algae ) \\n  31 cyanophyta ( blue @-@ green algae ) \\n  rarer species include : \\n  itonoa marginifera ( j.agardh ) masuda & guiry \\n  schmitzia hiscockiana maggs & guiry \\n  gelidiella calcicola maggs & guiry \\n  gelidium maggsiae rico & guiry \\n  halymenia latifolia p.l.crouan & h.m.crouan ex kützing . \\n  the island has been invaded by some algae , some of which are now well established . for example : \\n  asparagopsis armara harvey , which originated in australia and was first recorded by m. de valera in 1939 \\n  colpomenia peregrina sauvageau , which is now locally abundant and first recorded in the 1930s \\n  sargassum muticum ( yendo ) fensholt , now well established in a number of localities on the south , west , and north @-@ east coasts \\n  codium fragile ssp. fragile ( formerly reported as ssp. tomentosum ) , now well established . \\n  codium fragile ssp. atlanticum has been established to be native , although for many years it was regarded as an alien species . \\n  because of its mild climate , many species , including sub @-@ tropical species such as palm trees , are grown in ireland . phytogeographically , ireland belongs to the atlantic european province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom . the island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions : the celtic broadleaf forests and north atlantic moist mixed forests . \\n  = = = impact of agriculture = = = \\n  the long history of agricultural production , coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams , rivers and lakes , impact the natural fresh @-@ water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in ireland . \\n  a land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species . hedgerows , however , traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries , act as a refuge for native wild flora . this ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island . subsidies under the common agricultural policy , which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments , are undergoing reforms . the common agricultural policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices , for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides ; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements . \\n  forest covers about 12 @.@ 6 % of the country , most of it designated for commercial production . forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non @-@ native species , which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates . remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island , in particular in the killarney national park . natural areas require fencing to prevent over @-@ grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas . grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country . \\n  = = demographics = = \\n  people have lived in ireland for over 9 @,@ 000 years . the different eras are termed mesolithic , neolithic , bronze age , and iron age . \\n  early historical and genealogical records note the

rest of the population adhere to one of the various protestant denominations ( about 48 % of northern ireland ) . the largest is the anglican church of ireland . the muslim community is growing in ireland , mostly through increased immigration , with a 50 % increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census . the island has a small jewish community . about 4 % of the republic \\'s population and about 14 % of the northern ireland population describe themselves as of no religion . in a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the irish times , 32 % of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week . \\n  the population of ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid @-@ 19th century , but a devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake . over the following century the population was reduced by over half , at a time when the general trend in european countries was for populations to rise by an average of three @-@ fold . \\n  = = = divisions and settlements = = = \\n  traditionally , ireland is subdivided into four provinces : connacht ( west ) , leinster ( east ) , munster ( south ) , and ulster ( north ) . in a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries , ireland has 32 traditional counties . twenty @-@ six of these counties are in the republic of ireland and six are in northern ireland . the six counties that constitute northern ireland are all in the province of ulster ( which has nine counties in total ) . as such , ulster is often used as a synonym for northern ireland , although the two are not coterminous . \\n  in the republic of ireland , counties form the basis of the system of local government . counties dublin , cork , limerick , galway , waterford and tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas . however , they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes , for example postal addresses and by the ordnance survey ireland . counties in northern ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes , but , as in the republic , their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts . \\n  city status in ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter . dublin , with over 1 million residents in the greater dublin area , is the largest city on the island . belfast , with 579 @,@ 726 residents , is the largest city in northern ireland . city status does not directly equate with population size . for example , armagh , with 14 @,@ 590 is the seat of the church of ireland and the roman catholic primate of all ireland and was re @-@ granted city status by queen elizabeth ii in 1994 ( having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840 ) . in the republic of ireland , kilkenny , seat of the butler dynasty , while no longer a city for administrative purposes ( since the 2001 local government act ) , is entitled by law to continue to use the description . \\n  = = = migration = = = \\n  the population of ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century . a population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921 . in part , the fall in population was due to death from the great famine of 1845 to 1852 , which took about 1 million lives . however , by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century . \\n  emigration from ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of england , the united states , canada and australia , where a large irish diaspora lives . as of 2006 , 4 @.@ 3 million canadians , or 14 % of the population , are of irish descent . as of 2013 , a total of 34 @.@ 5 million americans claim irish ancestry . \\n  with growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century , ireland became a destination for immigrants . since the european union expanded to include poland in 2004 , polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants ( over 150 @,@ 000 ) from central europe . there has also been significant immigration from lithuania , the czech republic and latvia . \\n  the republic of ireland in particular has seen large @-@ scale immigration , with 420 @,@ 000 foreign nationals as of 2006 , about 10 % of the population . a quarter of births ( 24 percent ) in 2009 were to mothers born outside ireland . chinese and nigerians , along with people from other african countries , have accounted for a large proportion of the non – european union migrants to ireland . up to 50 @,@ 000 eastern and central european migrant workers left ireland in response to the irish financial crisis . \\n  = = = languages = = = \\n  two main languages are spoken in ireland : irish and english . both languages have widely contributed to literature . irish , now a minority but official language of the republic of ireland , was the vernacular of the irish people for over two thousand years and was probably introduced by some sort of proto @-@ gaelic migration during the iron age , possibly earlier . it began to be written down after christianisation in the 5th century and spread to scotland and the isle of man where it evolved into the scottish gaelic and manx languages respectively . \\n  the irish language has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries , and is divided by linguists into old irish from the 6th to 10th century , middle irish from the 10th to 13th century , early modern irish until the 17th century , and the modern irish spoken today . it remained the dominant language of ireland for most of those periods , having influences from latin , old norse , french and english . it declined under british rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century , and since then has been a minority language , although revival efforts are continuing in both the republic of ireland and northern ireland . \\n  gaeltacht or irish @-@ speaking areas are still seeing a decline in the language . the main gaeltacht areas are down the west of the country , in donegal , mayo , galway and kerry with smaller gaeltacht areas near dungarvan in waterford , navan , in meath , and the shaw \\'s road in belfast . irish language is a compulsory subject in the state education system in the republic , and the gaelscoil movement has seen many irish medium schools established in both jurisdictions . \\n  english was first introduced to ireland in the norman invasion . it was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from england , and was largely replaced by irish before the tudor conquest of ireland . it was introduced as the official language with the tudor and cromwellian conquests . the ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in ulster , and it remained the official and upper @-@ class language elsewhere , the irish @-@ speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed . language shift during the 19th century replaced irish with english as the first language for a vast majority of the population . \\n  less than 10 % of the population of the republic of ireland today speak irish regularly outside of the education system and 38 % of those over 15 years are classified as \" irish speakers \" . in northern ireland , english is the de facto official language , but official recognition is afforded to irish , including specific protective measures under part iii of the european charter for regional or minority languages . a lesser status ( including recognition under part ii of the charter ) is given to ulster scots dialects , which are spoken by roughly 2 % of northern ireland residents , and also spoken by some in the republic of ireland . since the 1960s with the increase in immigration , many more languages have been introduced , particularly deriving from asia and eastern europe . \\n  = = culture = = \\n  ireland \\'s culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples , later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences ( chiefly gaelic culture , anglicisation , americanisation and aspects of broader european culture ) . in broad terms , ireland is regarded as one of the celtic nations of europe , alongside scotland , wales , cornwall , isle of man and brittany . this combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed irish interlace or celtic knotwork . these can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works . the style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art , as is the distinctive style of traditional irish music and dance , and has become indicative of modern \" celtic \" culture in general . \\n  religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times ( and since the 17th century plantations , has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island ) . ireland \\'s pre @-@ christian heritage fused with the celtic church following the missions of saint patrick in the 5th century . the hiberno @-@ scottish missions , begun by the irish monk saint columba , spread the irish vision of christianity to pagan england and the frankish empire . these missions brought written language to an illiterate population of europe during the dark ages that followed the fall of rome , earning ireland the sobriquet , \" the island of saints and scholars \" . \\n  since the 20th century the irish pubs worldwide have become , especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings , outposts of irish culture . \\n  the republic of ireland \\'s national theatre is the abbey theatre , which was founded in 1904 , and the national irish @-@ language theatre is an taibhdhearc , which was established in 1928 in galway . playwrights such as seán o \\'casey , brian friel , sebastian barry , conor mcpherson and billy roche are internationally renowned . \\n  = = = arts = = = \\n  ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches , particularly in the english language . poetry in irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in europe , with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century . in english , jonathan swift , still often called the foremost satirist in the english language , was very popular in his day for works such as gulliver \\'s travels and a modest proposal , and oscar wilde is known most for his often quoted witticisms . \\n  in the 20th century , ireland produced four winners of the nobel prize for literature : george bernard shaw , william butler yeats , samuel beckett and seamus heaney . although not a nobel prize winner , james joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century . joyce \\'s 1922 novel ulysses is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 june in dublin as \" bloomsday \" . modern irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage through writers such as john mcgahern and poets such as seamus heaney . \\n  music has been in evidence in ireland since prehistoric times . although in the early middle ages the church was \" quite unlike its counterpart in continental europe \" , there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in ireland and the rest of europe that contributed to what is known as gregorian chant . outside religious establishments , musical genres in early gaelic ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music ( goltraige ) , laughing music ( geantraige ) and sleeping music ( suantraige ) . vocal and instrumental music ( e.g. for the harp , pipes , and various string instruments ) was transmitted orally , but the irish harp , in particular , was of such significance that it became ireland \\'s national symbol . classical music following european models first developed in urban areas , in establishments of anglo @-@ irish rule such as dublin castle , st patrick \\'s cathedral and christ church as well as the country houses of the anglo @-@ irish ascendancy , with the first performance of handel \\'s messiah ( 1742 ) being among the highlights of the baroque era . in the 19th century , public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society . yet , for political and financial reasons ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians , so the names of the better @-@ known irish composers of this time belong to emigrants . \\n  irish traditional music and dance has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s . in the middle years of the 20th century , as irish society was modernising , traditional music had fallen out of favour , especially in urban areas . however during the 1960s , there was a revival of interest in irish traditional music led by groups such as the dubliners , the chieftains , the wolfe tones , the clancy brothers , sweeney \\'s men and individuals like seán ó riada and christy moore . groups and musicians including horslips , van morrison and thin lizzy incorporated elements of irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and , during the 1970s and 1980s , the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred , with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing . this trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like enya , the saw doctors , the corrs , sinéad o \\'connor , clannad , the cranberries and the pogues among others . since then there have been a number of stylistic fusions including folk metal and others , while some contemporary music groups stick closer to a \" traditional \" sound . \\n  the earliest known irish graphic art and sculpture are neolithic carvings found at sites such as newgrange and is traced through bronze age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period . during the course of the 19th and 20th centuries , a strong tradition of painting emerged , including such figures as john butler yeats , william orpen , jack yeats and louis le brocquy . contemporary irish visual artists of note include sean scully , kevin abosch , and alice maher . \\n  = = = science = = = \\n  the irish philosopher and theologian johannes scotus eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his early middle ages . sir ernest henry shackleton , an irish explorer , was one of the principal figures of antarctic exploration . he , along with his expedition , made the first ascent of mount erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the south magnetic pole . robert boyle was a 17th @-@ century natural philosopher , chemist , physicist , inventor and early gentleman scientist . he is largely regarded one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of boyle \\'s law . \\n  19th century physicist , john tyndall , discovered the tyndall effect . father nicholas joseph callan , professor of natural philosophy in maynooth college , is best known for his invention of the induction coil , transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century . \\n  other notable irish physicists include ernest walton , winner of the 1951 nobel prize in physics . with sir john douglas cockcroft , he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation . william thomson , or lord kelvin , is the person whom the absolute temperature unit , the kelvin , is named after . sir joseph larmor , a physicist and mathematician , made innovations in the understanding of electricity , dynamics , thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter . his most influential work was aether and matter , a book on theoretical physics published in 1900 . \\n  george johnstone stoney introduced the term electron in 1891 . john stewart bell was the originator of bell \\'s theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the bell @-@ jackiw @-@ adler anomaly and was nominated for a nobel prize . notable mathematicians include sir william rowan hamilton , famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions . francis ysidro edgeworth \\'s contribution of the edgeworth box remains influential in neo @-@ classical microeconomic theory to this day ; while richard cantillon inspired adam smith , among others . john b. cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000 @-@ digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite fermat number in 2003 . john lighton synge made progress in different fields of science , including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity . he had mathematician john nash as one of his students . \\n  ireland has nine universities , seven in the republic of ireland and two in northern ireland , including trinity college , dublin and the university college dublin , as well as numerous third @-@ level colleges and institutes and a branch of the open university , the open university in ireland . \\n  = = = sports = = = \\n  the island of ireland fields a single international team in most sports . one notable exception to this is association football , although both associations continued to field international teams under the name \" ireland \" until the 1950s . an all @-@ ireland club competition for soccer , the setanta cup , was created in 2005 . \\n  gaelic football is the most popular sport in ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement , with about 2 @,@ 600 clubs on the island . in 2003 it represented 34 % of total sports attendances at events in ireland and abroad , followed by hurling at 23 % , soccer at 16 % and rugby at 8 % and the all @-@ ireland football final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar . soccer is the most widely played team game on the island , and the most popular in northern ireland . swimming , golf , aerobics , soccer , cycling , gaelic football and billiards / snooker are the sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation . the sport is also the most notable exception where the republic of ireland and northern ireland field separate international teams . northern ireland has produced two world snooker champions . \\n  many other sports are also played and followed , including basketball , boxing , cricket , fishing , greyhound racing , handball , hockey , horse racing , motor sport , show jumping and tennis . \\n  = = = = field sports = = = = \\n  gaelic football , hurling and handball are the best @-@ known of the irish traditional sports , collectively known as gaelic games . gaelic games are governed by the gaelic athletic association ( gaa ) , with the exception of ladies \\' gaelic football and camogie ( women \\'s variant of hurling ) , which are governed by separate organisations . the headquarters of the gaa ( and the main stadium ) is located at the 82 @,@ 500 capacity croke park in north dublin . many major gaa games are played there , including the semi @-@ finals and finals of the all @-@ ireland senior football championship and all @-@ ireland senior hurling championship . during the redevelopment of the lansdowne road stadium in 2007 – 10 , international rugby and soccer were played there . all gaa players , even at the highest level , are amateurs , receiving no wages , although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport @-@ related income from commercial sponsorship . \\n  the irish football association ( ifa ) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island . the game has been played in an organised fashion in ireland since the 1870s , with cliftonville f.c. in belfast being ireland \\'s oldest club . it was most popular , especially in its first decades , around belfast and in ulster . however , some clubs based outside belfast thought that the ifa largely favoured ulster @-@ based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team . in 1921 , following an incident in which , despite an earlier promise , the ifa moved an irish cup semi @-@ final replay from dublin to belfast , dublin @-@ based clubs broke away to form the football association of the irish free state . today the southern association is known as the football association of ireland ( fai ) . despite being initially blacklisted by the home nations \\' associations , the fai was recognised by fifa in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 ( against italy ) . however , both the ifa and fai continued to select their teams from the whole of ireland , with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams . both also referred to their respective teams as ireland . \\n  in 1950 , fifa directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and , in 1953 , directed that the fai \\'s team be known only as \" republic of ireland \" and that the ifa \\'s team be known as \" northern ireland \" ( with certain exceptions ) . northern ireland qualified for the world cup finals in 1958 ( reaching the quarter @-@ finals ) , 1982 and 1986 . the republic qualified for the world cup finals in 1990 ( reaching the quarter @-@ finals ) , 1994 , 2002 and the european championships in 1988 and 2012 . across ireland , there is significant interest in the english and , to a lesser extent , scottish soccer leagues . \\n  unlike soccer , ireland continues to field a single national rugby team and a single association , the irish rugby football union ( irfu ) , governs the sport across the island . the irish rugby team have played in every rugby world cup , making the quarter @-@ finals in four of them . ireland also hosted games during the 1991 and the 1999 rugby world cups ( including a quarter @-@ final ) . there are four professional irish teams ; all four play in the magners league ( now called the rabodirect pro12 ) and at least three compete for the heineken cup . irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994 . during that time , ulster ( 1999 ) , munster ( 2006 and 2008 ) and leinster ( 2009 , 2011 and 2012 ) have won the heineken cup . in addition to this , the irish international side has had increased success in the six nations championship against the other european elite sides . this success , including triple crowns in 2004 , 2006 and 2007 , culminated with a clean sweep of victories , known as a grand slam , in 2009 . \\n  = = = = other sports = = = = \\n  horse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in ireland . there are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well @-@ attended . the island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs . the horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the county kildare . \\n  irish athletics has seen a heightened success rate since the year 2000 , with sonia o \\'sullivan winning two medals at 5 @,@ 000 metres on the track ; gold at the 1995 world championships and silver at the 2000 sydney olympics . gillian o \\'sullivan won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 world championships , while sprint hurdler derval o \\'rourke won gold at the 2006 world indoor championship in moscow . olive loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk in the world athletics championships in berlin in 2009 . \\n  ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other olympic sport . boxing is governed by the irish amateur boxing association . michael carruth won a gold medal and wayne mccullough won a silver medal in the barcelona olympic games and in 2008 kenneth egan won a silver medal in the beijing games . paddy barnes secured bronze in those games and gold in the 2010 european amateur boxing championships ( where ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table ) and 2010 commonwealth games . katie taylor has won gold in every european and world championship since 2005 . in august 2012 at the olympic games in london katie taylor created history by becoming the first irish woman to win a gold medal in boxing in the 60 kg lightweight . \\n  golf is very popular and golf tourism is a major industry attracting more than 240 @,@ 000 golfing visitors annually . the 2006 ryder cup was held at the k club in county kildare . pádraig harrington became the first irishman since fred daly in 1947 to win the british open at carnoustie in july 2007 . he successfully defended his title in july 2008 before going on to win the pga championship in august . harrington became the first european to win the pga championship in 78 years and was the first winner from ireland . three golfers from northern ireland have been particularly successful . in 2010 , graeme mcdowell became the first irish golfer to win the u.s. open , and the first european to win that tournament since 1970 . rory mcilroy , at the age of 22 , won the 2011 u.s. open , while darren clarke \\'s latest victory was the 2011 open championship at royal st. george \\'s

donegal bay in particular , have popular surfing beaches , being fully exposed to the atlantic ocean . donegal bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west / south @-@ west atlantic winds , creating good surf , especially in winter . since just before the year 2010 , bundoran has hosted european championship surfing . scuba diving is increasingly popular in ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life , particularly along the western seaboard . there are also many shipwrecks along the coast of ireland , with some of the best wreck dives being in malin head and off the county cork coast . \\n  with thousands of lakes , over 14 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 8 @,@ 700 mi ) of fish bearing rivers and over 3 @,@ 700 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 300 mi ) of coastline , ireland is a popular angling destination . the temperate irish climate is suited to sport angling . while salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers , salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery . coarse fishing continues to increase its profile . sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted , and the range of sea angling species is around 80 . \\n  = = = food and drink = = = \\n  food and cuisine in ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island \\'s temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of irish history . for example , whilst from the middle ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the irish economy was the herding of cattle , the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing . thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk @-@ producing cow . \\n  for this reason , pork and white meat were more common than beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon ( or rashers ) and the eating of salted butter ( i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself ) have been a central feature of the diet in ireland since the middle ages . the practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter ( not unlike the practice of the maasai ) was common and black pudding , made from blood , grain ( usually barley ) and seasoning , remains a breakfast staple in ireland . all of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the \" breakfast roll \" . \\n  the introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter . great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid @-@ 19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk . a typical family , consisting of a man , a woman and four children , would eat 18 stone ( 110 kg ) of potatoes a week . consequently , dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking , such as the irish stew , bacon and cabbage , boxty , a type of potato pancake , or colcannon , a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage . \\n  since the last quarter of the 20th century , with a re @-@ emergence of wealth in ireland , a \" new irish cuisine \" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged . this cuisine is based on fresh vegetables , fish ( especially salmon , trout , oysters , mussels and other shellfish ) , as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand @-@ made cheeses that are now being produced across the country . the potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in europe . an example of this new cuisine is \" dublin lawyer \" : lobster cooked in whiskey and cream . traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country , for example coddle in dublin or drisheen in cork , both a type of sausage , or blaa , a doughy white bread particular to waterford . \\n  ireland once dominated the world \\'s market for whiskey , producing 90 % of the world \\'s whiskey at the start of the 20th century . however , as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the united states ( who sold poor @-@ quality whiskey bearing irish @-@ sounding names thus eroding the pre @-@ prohibition popularity for irish brands ) and tariffs on irish whiskey across the british empire during the anglo @-@ irish trade war of the 1930s , sales of irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2 % by the mid @-@ 20th century . in 1953 , an irish government survey , found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the united states had never heard of irish whiskey . \\n  irish whiskey , as researched in 2009 by the cnbc american broadcaster , remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades . typically cnbc states irish whiskey is not as smoky as a scotch whisky , but not as sweet as american or canadian whiskies . whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs , such as baileys , and the \" irish coffee \" ( a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at foynes flying @-@ boat station ) is probably the best @-@ known irish cocktail . \\n  stout , a kind of porter beer , particularly guinness , is typically associated with ireland , although historically it was more closely associated with london . porter remains very popular , although it has lost sales since the mid @-@ 20th century to lager . cider , particularly magners ( marketed in the republic of ireland as bulmers ) , is also a popular drink . red lemonade , a soft @-@ drink , is consumed on its own and as a mixer , particularly with whiskey . \\n  = st nazaire raid = \\n  the st nazaire raid or operation chariot was a successful british amphibious attack on the heavily defended normandie dry dock at st nazaire in german @-@ occupied france during the second world war . the operation was undertaken by the royal navy and british commandos under the auspices of combined operations headquarters on 28 march 1942 . st nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large german warship in need of repairs , such as the tirpitz , to return to home waters via either the english channel or the giuk gap , both of which were heavily defended by british units including the royal navy \\'s home fleet , rather than having a haven available on the atlantic coast . \\n  the obsolete destroyer hms campbeltown , accompanied by 18 smaller craft , crossed the english channel to the atlantic coast of france and was rammed into the normandie dock gates . the ship had been packed with delayed @-@ action explosives , well hidden within a steel and concrete case , that detonated later that day , putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to five years after . \\n  a force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures . heavy german gunfire sank , set ablaze or immobilised all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to england ; the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland . they were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded . \\n  after the raid 228 men of the force of 611 returned to britain ; 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war . german casualties were over 360 dead , some killed after the raid when campbeltown exploded . to recognise their bravery , 89 decorations were awarded to members of the raiding party , including five victoria crosses . after the war , st nazaire was one of 38 battle honours awarded to the commandos ; the operation has since become known as the greatest raid of all within military circles . \\n  = = background = = \\n  st nazaire is on the north bank of the loire 400 km ( 250 miles ) from the nearest british port . in 1942 , it had a population of 50 @,@ 000 . the st nazaire port has an outer harbour known as the avant port , formed by two piers jutting out into the atlantic ocean . this leads to two lock gates before the bassin de st nazaire . these gates control the water level in the basin so that it is not affected by the tide . \\n  beyond the basin is the larger inner dock called the bassin de penhoët , which can accommodate ships up to 10 @,@ 000 tons . there is also an old entrance to the bassin de st nazaire located southwest of the normandie dry dock . built to house the ocean liner ss normandie , this dock was the largest dry dock in the world when it was completed in 1932 . the \" old mole \" jetty juts into the loire halfway between the southern pier of the avant port and the old entrance into the basin . \\n  on 24 may 1941 , the battle of the denmark strait was fought between the german ships bismarck and prinz eugen and the british ships hms prince of wales and hms hood . hood was sunk and the damaged prince of wales was forced to retire . bismarck , also damaged , ordered her consort to proceed independently while she headed for the french port of st nazaire , which was the only port on the atlantic coast with a dry dock able to accommodate a ship of her size . she was intercepted by the british and sunk en route . \\n  britain \\'s naval intelligence division first proposed a commando raid on the dock in late 1941 . when the german battleship tirpitz was declared operational in january 1942 , the royal navy ( rn ) and royal air force ( raf ) were already drawing up plans to attack her . planners from combined operations headquarters were looking at potential scenarios if tirpitz escaped the naval blockade and reached the atlantic . they decided the only port able to accommodate her was st nazaire , especially if , like the bismarck , she was damaged en route and needed repairs . they came to the conclusion that if the dock at st nazaire were unavailable the germans were unlikely to risk sending tirpitz into the atlantic . \\n  combined operations examined a number of options while planning the destruction of the dock . at this stage of the war the british government still tried to avoid civilian casualties . this ruled out a bombing attack by the raf , which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life . \\n  the special operations executive were approached to see if its agents could destroy the dock gates . they decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them . the royal navy was also unable to mount an operation , as st nazaire is 8 km ( 5 miles ) up the loire estuary . any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range . \\n  the planners then examined whether a commando force was feasible to accomplish the task . an unusually high spring tide was due in march 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks , bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel . the approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship , but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through . \\n  = = plan = = \\n  the purpose of the raid was to destroy three objectives : the normandie dock , the old gates into the bassin de st nazaire together with the water pumping machinery and other installations , and any u @-@ boats or other shipping in the area . the initial combined operations plan required two specially lightened destroyers to carry out the raid . the first would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates . \\n  commandos on board would then disembark and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations , searchlights and gun emplacements . the destroyer would then be blown up , and the second ship would come in and evacuate the ship \\'s crew and the commandos . at the same time the raf would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area . \\n  when the plan was presented to the admiralty they refused to support it . the certain loss of one or both destroyers to eliminate the dry dock was out of the question . they suggested they could provide an old free french destroyer , the ouragan , and a flotilla of small motor launches to transport the commandos and evacuate them afterwards . \\n  approval for the mission , codenamed operation chariot , was given on 3 march 1942 . using a french ship would involve using the free french forces and increase the number of people aware of the raid . consequently , it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own . the raf complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources ; the number of aircraft assigned by raf bomber command was reduced time and again before the day of the raid . british prime minister winston churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified . \\n  combined operations headquarters worked closely with several intelligence organisations to plan the raid . the naval intelligence division compiled information from a variety of sources . a detailed plan of the town of st nazaire was provided by the secret intelligence service , and information on the coastal artillery nearby was sourced from the war office \\'s military intelligence branch . intelligence about the dock itself came from pre @-@ war technical journals . \\n  the rn \\'s operational intelligence centre selected the route and timing for the raid based on intelligence about the location of minefields and german recognition signals sourced from enigma decrypts and knowledge of luftwaffe patrols compiled by the air ministry \\'s air intelligence branch . when all the plans had been pulled together and the timing worked out , the raid was expected to last no longer than two hours . the commandos and crew from campbeltown would board the motor launches at the old mole jetty and then return to base . \\n  = = composition of the raiding force = = \\n  the revised combined operations plan required one destroyer to ram the dock gates and a number of smaller craft to transport the commandos . the royal navy would therefore provide the largest contingent for the raid , under the overall command of the senior naval officer , commander robert ryder . the ship selected to ram into the dock gates was hms campbeltown , commanded by lieutenant commander stephen halden beattie . campbeltown was a first world war destroyer and had previously been the uss buchanan in the united states navy . she had come into rn service in 1940 as one of 50 destroyers transferred to the united kingdom under the destroyers for bases agreement . \\n  converting campbeltown for the raid took ten days . she had to be lightened to raise her draught to get over the sand banks in the estuary . this was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments . the dockyard removed her three 4 inch ( 100 mm ) guns , torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick – firing 12 pounder ( 3 \" ) . eight 20 mm oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level . the bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour @-@ plate protection , and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the commandos on the open deck . \\n  two of her four funnels were removed , and the forward two were cut at an angle to resemble those of a german destroyer . the bow was packed with 4 @.@ 5 tons of high explosives , which were set in concrete . it was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour . to prevent the germans towing her away , the crew would open the ship \\'s seacocks before abandoning the ship . should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock , four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore . the charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left . \\n  other naval units involved were two hunt class destroyers , hms tynedale ( l96 ) and atherstone ( l05 ) , which would accompany the force to and from the french coast and remain out at sea during the raid . a motor gun boat ( mgb 314 ) was the headquarters ship for the raid , with commander ryder and the commanding officer of the commandos on board . a motor torpedo boat ( mtb 74 ) , commanded by sub @-@ lieutenant michael wynn , had two objectives : if the outer normandie dock gates were open , she had to torpedo the inner dock gates . if the gates were closed she would instead torpedo the gates at the old entrance into the st nazaire basin . \\n  to assist in transporting the commandos , 12 motor launches ( ml ) were assigned from the 20th and 28th motor launch flotillas . these boats were re @-@ armed with two oerlikon 20 mm guns mounted forward and aft to complement their twin lewis guns . at the last minute another four mls were assigned from the 7th motor launch flotilla ( see footnotes for flotilla details ) . these four boats were also armed with two torpedoes each . instead of transporting the commandos , these boats were to engage any german shipping found in the estuary . all the mls had a 500 @-@ gallon auxiliary fuel tank fixed to the upper deck to increase their range . the s class submarine hms sturgeon would leave before the rest of the convoy and be in position to act as a navigational beacon to guide the convoy into the loire estuary . \\n  the man selected to lead the commando force was lieutenant colonel charles newman ; his no. 2 commando would provide the largest commandos contingent , 173 men , for the raid . the special service brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , and 12 commandos . \\n  the commandos were divided into three groups ; one and two would travel in the mls , while three would be in campbeltown . under the command of captain hodgeson , group one had the objectives of securing the old mole and eliminating the anti @-@ aircraft gun positions around the southern quays . they were then to move into the old town and blow up the power station , bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the avant port . the capture of the mole was a major objective , as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission . \\n  group two , under the command of captain burn , would land at the old entrance to the st nazaire basin . their objectives were to destroy the anti @-@ aircraft positions in the area and the german headquarters , to blow up the locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter @-@ attack from the submarine base . group three was under the command of major william \\' bill \\' copland , who was also the commandos \\' second in command . they were to secure the immediate area around campbeltown , destroy the dock \\'s water @-@ pumping and gate @-@ opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks . all three groups were subdivided into assault , demolition and protection teams . the assault teams would clear the way for the other two . the demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self @-@ defence ; the protection teams , armed with thompson submachine guns , were to defend them while they completed their tasks . \\n  the commandos were aided in their planning for the operation by captain bill pritchard of the royal engineers , who had pre @-@ war experience as an apprentice in the great western railway dockyards and whose father was the dock master of cardiff docks . in 1940 while part of the british expeditionary force in france , his duties had included determining how to disable the french dockyards if they were captured . one of the dockyards he had studied was st nazaire , and he had submitted a report detailing how to put the dock out of action . \\n  = = german forces = = \\n  the germans had around 5 @,@ 000 troops in the immediate area of st nazaire . the port was defended by the 280th naval artillery battalion under the command of kapitän zur see edo dieckmann . the battalion was composed of 28 guns of various calibres from 75 mm to 280 mm railway guns , all positioned to guard the coastal approaches . the heavy guns were supplemented by the guns and searchlights of the 22nd naval flak brigade under the command of kapitän zur see karl @-@ konrad mecke . \\n  the brigade was equipped with 43 anti @-@ aircraft guns ranging in calibre from 20 to 40 mm . these guns had a dual role as both anti @-@ aircraft and coastal defence weapons . many were in concrete emplacements on top of the submarine pens and other dockside installations of the st nazaire submarine base . \\n  the harbour defence companies were responsible for local defence and for the security of the ships and submarines moored in the harbour . these companies and the harbour defence boats used to patrol the river were under the command of harbour commander korvettenkapitän kellerman . the 333rd infantry division was the german army unit responsible for the defence of the coast between st nazaire and lorient . the division had no troops based in the town , but some were located in villages nearby and would be able to respond to any attack on the port . \\n  the kriegsmarine ( german navy ) had at least three surface ships in the loire estuary : a destroyer , an armed trawler and a sperrbrecher ( minesweeper ) , the latter being the guard ship for the port . on the night of the raid there were also four harbour defence boats and ten ships from the 16th and 42nd minesweeper flotillas berthed in the basin , while two tankers were berthed inside the normandie dock . the 6th and 7th u @-@ boat flotillas , commanded by kapitänleutnant georg @-@ wilhelm schulz and korvettenkapitän herbert sohler respectively , were permanently based in the port . it is not known how many submarines were present on the day of the raid . the submarine base had been inspected by the u @-@ boat commander in chief , vizeadmiral karl dönitz , the day before the raid . he asked what would they do if the base was subject to an attack by british commandos . sohler replied that \" an attack on the base would be hazardous and highly improbable \" . \\n  = = the raid = = \\n  = = = outward journey = = = \\n  the three destroyers and 16 small boats left falmouth , cornwall at 14 : 00 on 26 march 1942 . they formed into a convoy of three lanes , with the destroyers in the middle . on arrival at st nazaire the portside mls were to head for the old mole to disembark their commandos , while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs . not having the range to reach st nazaire unaided , the mtb and mgb were taken under tow by campbeltown and atherstone . \\n  on 27 march at 07 : 20 tynedale reported a u @-@ boat on the surface and opened fire . the two escort destroyers left the convoy to engage the u @-@ boat , later identified as u @-@ 593 . the u @-@ boat promptly dived and was unsuccessfully attacked by depth charges . the two destroyers returned to the convoy at 09 : 00 . \\n  the convoy next encountered two french fishing trawlers . both crews were taken off and the ships sunk for fear they might report the composition and location of the convoy . at 17 : 00 the convoy received a signal from commander @-@ in @-@ chief plymouth that five german torpedo boats were in the area . two hours later another signal informed them that another two hunt class destroyers , hms cleveland and hms brocklesby , had been dispatched at full speed to join the convoy . \\n  the convoy reached a position 65 nautical miles ( 120 km ; 75 mi ) off st nazaire at 21 : 00 and changed course toward the estuary , leaving atherstone and tynedale as a sea patrol . the convoy adopted a new formation with the mgb and two torpedo mls in the lead , followed by campbeltown . the rest of the mls formed two columns on either side and astern of the destroyer , with the mtb bringing up the rear . the first casualty of the raid was ml 341 , which had developed engine trouble and was abandoned . at 22 : 00 the submarine sturgeon directed her navigation beacon out to sea to guide the convoy in . at about the same time campbeltown raised the german naval ensign in an attempt to deceive any german lookouts into thinking she was a german destroyer . \\n  at 23 : 30 on 27 march , five raf squadrons ( comprising 35 whitleys and 27 wellingtons ) started their bombing runs . the bombers had to stay above 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) and were supposed to remain over the port for 60 minutes to divert attention toward themselves and away from the sea . they had orders to only bomb clearly identified military targets and to drop only one bomb at a time . as it turned out , poor weather over the port ( 10 / 10ths cloud ) meant that only four aircraft bombed targets in st nazaire . six aircraft managed to bomb other nearby targets . \\n  the unusual behaviour of the bombers concerned kapitän zur see mecke . at 00 : 00 on 28 march , he issued a warning that there might be a parachute landing in progress . at 01 : 00 on 28 march , he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port . everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert . the harbour defence companies and ships \\' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters . during all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea , so mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour . \\n  = = = ramming the dry dock = = = \\n  at 00 : 30 hours on 28 march the convoy crossed over the shoals at the mouth of the loire estuary , with campbeltown scraping the bottom twice . each time she was able to pull free , and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness . they had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01 : 22 the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary . a naval signal light demanded their identification . \\n  the mgb @-@ 314 replied in a coded response obtained from a german trawler boarded during the vågsøy raid . a few bursts were fired from a shore battery and both campbeltown and mgb @-@ 314 replied : \" ship being fired upon by friendly forces \" . the deception gave them a little more time before every german gun in the bay opened fire . at 01 : 28 , with the convoy 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the dock gates , beattie ordered the german flag lowered and the white ensign raised . the intensity of the german fire seemed to increase . the guard ship opened fire and was quickly silenced when the ships in the convoy responded , shooting into her as they passed . \\n  by now all the ships in the convoy were within range to engage targets ashore and were firing at the gun emplacements and searchlights . campbeltown was hit a number of times and increased her speed to 19 kn ( 35 km / h ) . the helmsman on her bridge was killed ; his replacement was wounded and replaced as well . blinded by the searchlights , beattie knew they were close to their objective . still under heavy fire , the mgb turned into the estuary as campbeltown cleared the end of the old mole , cut through anti @-@ torpedo netting strung across the entrance and rammed the dock gates , striking home at 01 : 34 , three minutes later than scheduled . the force of the impact drove the ship 33 feet ( 10 m ) onto the gates . \\n  = = = disembarkation from campbeltown and the mls = = = \\n  the commandos on campbeltown now disembarked : two assault teams , five demolition teams with their protectors and a mortar group . three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations associated with the dry dock . the kilt @-@ wearing captain donald roy - \\' the laird \\' - and his 14 @-@ man assault troop were tasked with inactivating two pump @-@ house roof @-@ top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area . roy and sgt don randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former , and a head @-@ on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled capt. bob montgomery and lt corran purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area . \\n  they lost 4 men in this action . the fifth team also succeeded in completing all their objectives but almost half its men were killed . the other two commando groups were not as successful . the mls transporting groups one and two had almost all been destroyed on their approach . ml 457 was the only boat to land its commandos on the old mole and only ml 177 had managed to reach the gates at the old entrance to the basin . that team succeeded in planting charges on two tugboats moored in the basin . \\n  there were only two other mls in the vicinity : ml 160 had continued past the dock and was engaging targets upriver , ml 269 appeared to be out of control and was running in circles . by this time the crew of campbeltown had detonated the scuttling charges and gathered at the rear of the ship to be taken off . ml 177 came alongside the destroyer and took 30 men on board including beattie and some of the wounded . major copland went through campbeltown and evacuated the wounded towards the old mole , not knowing that there were no other boats there to take the commandos off . \\n  lt col newman aboard the mgb , need not have landed , but he was one of the first ashore . one of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun position on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the commandos . he next directed machine @-@ gun fire onto an armed trawler , which was forced to withdraw upriver . newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of german reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks . \\n  some 100 commandos were still ashore when newman realised that evacuation by sea was no longer an option . he gathered the survivors and issued three orders : \\n  to do our best to get back to england ; \\n  not to surrender until all our ammunition is exhausted ; \\n  not to surrender at all if we can help it . \\n  newman and copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town . the commandos attempted to get through the narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside , but were eventually surrounded . when their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender . not all the commandos were captured ; five men reached neutral spain , from where they eventually returned to england . \\n  = = = small ships = = = \\n  most of the mls had been destroyed on the run in and were burning . the first ml in the starboard column was the first boat to catch fire ; her captain managed to beach her at the end of the old mole . some starboard boats managed to reach their objective and disembark their commandos . ml 443 , the leading boat in the port column , got to within 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) of the mole in the face of heavy direct fire and hand grenades before being set on fire . the crew were rescued by ml 160 , one of the torpedo mls which had been looking for targets of opportunity such as the two large tankers reported to be in the harbour . the commanders of mls 160 and 443 , lieutenants t boyd and t d l platt , were awarded the distinguished service order for their bravery . the rest of the port column had been destroyed or disabled before reaching the mole . mls 192 and 262 were set on fire ; there were only six survivors . ml 268 was blown up ; one man survived . \\n  ml 177 , the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from campbeltown , was sunk on her way out of the estuary . ml 269 , another torpedo @-@ armed boat , had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw german fire away from the landings . soon after passing campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged . it took ten minutes to repair the steering . they turned and started in the other direction , opening fire on an armed trawler in passing . return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire . \\n  ml 306 also came under heavy fire when it arrived near the port . sergeant thomas durrant of no. 1 commando , manning the aft lewis gun , engaged gun and searchlight positions on the run in . he was wounded but refused to leave the gun for treatment . the ml reached the open sea but was attacked at short range by the german torpedo boat jaguar . durrant returned fire , aiming for the torpedo boat \\'s bridge . he was wounded again but remained at his gun even after the german commander asked for their surrender . firing drum after drum of ammunition , he refused to give up until after the ml had been boarded . durrant died of his wounds and , after the recommendation of the jaguar \\'s commander , was awarded a posthumous victoria cross . \\n  after the commando headquarters group had landed , commander ryder went to check for himself that campbeltown was firmly stuck in the dock . some of her surviving crewmen were being taken on board the mgb . ryder returned to the boat and ordered the mtb to carry out its alternative task and torpedo the lock gates at the old entrance to the basin . after a successful torpedo attack , ryder ordered the mtb to leave . on their way out of the estuary they stopped to collect survivors from a sinking ml and were hit and set on fire . back at the docks the mgb had positioned itself in mid @-@ river to engage enemy gun emplacements . the forward 2 pounder was manned by able seaman william alfred savage . commander ryder reported that \\n  \" the rate of supporting fire had evidently been felt , and the commandos in the area of the tirpitz dock had undoubtedly overcome the resistance in that area . there was an appreciable slackening in the enemy \\'s fire . \" \\n  ryder could see no ships other than seven or eight burning mls . he then realised that the landing places at the old mole and the entrance to the basin had both been recaptured by the germans . there was nothing more they could do for the commandos , so they headed out to sea . on their way they were continuously illuminated by german searchlights and were hit at least six times by the german guns . passing ml 270 , they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats . \\n  when they reached the open sea the smaller calibre guns were out of range and stopped firing but the heavier artillery continued to engage them . the boats were about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) off @-@ shore when the last german salvo straddled them and killed savage , who was still at his gun . he was awarded a posthumous victoria cross for his exploits . his citation recognised both savage and the bravery of \" the many unnamed crews of the motor gun boat , motor torpedo boat and motor launches who continued to carry out their duties in exposed positions , in the face of close range enemy fire . \" \\n  = = = return journey = = = \\n  at 06 : 30 the five german torpedo boats that the convoy had evaded the previous day were sighted by hms atherstone and tynedale . the two destroyers turned toward them and opened fire at a range of 7 miles ( 11 km ) . after ten minutes the german boats turned away , making smoke . the destroyers sighted the mgb and two accompanying mls soon after and transferred their casualties to the atherstone . not expecting any more boats to arrive , they headed for home . just after 09 : 00 the hunt @-@ class escort destroyers hms brocklesby and hms cleveland arrived , sent by commander @-@ in @-@ chief plymouth . shortly after this the ships were spotted by a heinkel 115 floatplane of the luftwaffe . \\n  the next german aircraft on the scene , a junkers 88 , was engaged by a raf bristol beaufighter which had appeared in the area earlier . both machines crashed into the sea . other german planes arrived but were driven off by beaufighters and hudsons from coastal command . the atlantic weather conditions deteriorated . amid concerns about the growing german threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships would not be able to keep up , commander sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk . \\n  three of the small vessels managed to return to england : mls 160 , 307 and 443 . they had reached the rendezvous and waited until 10 : 00 for the destroyers to appear . having already been attacked once , they moved further out into the atlantic to try and avoid the german air force , but a junkers 88 appeared overhead at 07 : 30 and approached them at low level for a closer look . the ships opened fire and hit the junkers in the cockpit . the plane went into the sea . the next aircraft to appear was a blohm and voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships , but left after being damaged by machine @-@ gun fire . the surviving mls eventually reached england unaided the following day . \\n  = = = campbeltown explodes = = = \\n  the explosive charges in hms campbeltown detonated at noon on 28 march 1942 , and the dry dock was destroyed . reports vary on the fate of the two tankers that were in the dock ; they were either swept away by the wall of water and sunk , or swept to the far end of the dock , but not sunk . a party of 40 senior german officers and civilians who were on a tour of campbeltown were killed . in total , the explosion killed about 360 men . the wreck of campbeltown could still be seen inside the dry dock months later when raf photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port . \\n  according to captain robert montgomery ( royal engineers , attached to no.2 commando ) , campbeltown was meant to have detonated at 4 : 30am , the delay caused , he believes , by some of the acid in the pencil fuses being distilled away . as the morning progressed , more and more captured comrades joined him in the german hq . \\n  the day after the explosion , organisation todt workers were assigned to clean up the debris and wreckage . on 30 march at 16 : 30 the torpedoes from mtb 74 , which were on a delayed fuse setting , exploded at the old entrance into the basin . this raised alarms among the germans . the organisation todt workers ran away from the dock area . german guards , mistaking their khaki uniforms for british uniforms , opened fire , killing some of them . the germans also thought that some commandos were still hiding in the town , and made a street by street search , during which some townspeople were also killed . \\n  = = aftermath = = \\n  the explosion put the dry dock out of commission for the remainder of the war . the st nazaire raid had been a success , but at a cost . of the 622 men of the royal navy and commandos who took part in the raid , only 228 men returned to england . five commandos escaped via neutral spain and gibraltar with the help of french citizens , and took a ship to england from gibraltar . 169 men were killed ( 105 rn and 64 commandos ) and another 215 became prisoners of war ( 106 rn and 109 commandos ) . they were first taken to la baule and then sent to stalag 133 at rennes . the fallen british raiders were buried at the la baule @-@ escoublac cemetery with military honours . the cemetery is located 13 kilometres west of st nazaire . \\n  to recognise their achievement , 89 decorations were awarded for the raid . this total includes the five victoria crosses awarded to lieutenant commander beattie , lieutenant colonel newman and commander ryder , and posthumous awards to sergeant durrant and able seaman savage . four distinguished service orders were awarded to major william copland , captain donald roy , lieutenant t boyd and lieutenant t d l platt . other decorations awarded were four conspicuous gallantry medals , five distinguished conduct medals , 17 distinguished service crosses , 11 military crosses , 24 distinguished service medals and 15 military medals . four men were awarded the croix de guerre by france , and another 51 were mentioned in despatches . \\n  adolf hitler was furious that the british had been able to sail a flotilla of ships up the loire unhindered . his immediate reaction was to dismiss generaloberst carl hilpert , chief @-@ of @-@ staff to the commander in chief west . the raid refocused german attention on the atlantic wall , and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid . by june 1942 the germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in u @-@ boat pens . hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with armaments minister albert speer in august 1942 , calling for the construction of 15 @,@ 000 bunkers by may 1943 to defend the atlantic coast from norway to spain . \\n'"
